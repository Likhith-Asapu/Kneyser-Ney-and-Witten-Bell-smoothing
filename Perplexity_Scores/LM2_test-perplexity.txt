Secondly, we must look at the capacity which each country has so that this total force of 60 000 soldiers is distributed in an orderly and efficient manner between the fifteen countries.	58.49446181287775
I thank the President-in-Office for his reply.	31.173750025152952
Can I say to her that the mechanisms that we are going to introduce of strategic planning and programming facilitated by activity-based management may sound to be immensely dry and completely bereft of any idealism.	48.942393311667516
Mr President, I am no friend of Milosevic or his government.	42.78176904486575
Madam President, it is clear that we in this Parliament are very largely agreed on rejecting Mr Haider and his politics, but it is equally clear that opinion differs as to the most effective way of opposing this brand of politics.	32.593439593621895
It could have sunk anywhere.	45.11114588765571
That most certainly is the intention of the Commission.	76.69658761854375
Ever since the early nineties, the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council of Ministers have recognised that this coherence of European policy is leaves something to be desired, especially in the field of development cooperation and in other EU policies.	34.90966270371029
I shall not even mention the instances of corruption in the Italian Socialist Party, because it does not do to kick a man when he is down, still less when he is dead and gone.	62.0349309989982
VOTE	91.612302720005
The Erika disaster must be the last in the series.	77.61513193164738
It seems to me that something is missing from this programme.	29.819098114121996
For the cars currently on the road, it would be reasonable to share the cost, for example by setting up a fund such as that in the Netherlands.	61.11064256382367
Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I must say that your comments have not satisfied me at all.	29.162997165778467
However, I should like once again to raise the issue of antibiotics.	23.886581025389845
Competition is run and managed in the interest of the citizens, their economic interest and for their liberty.	118.06856223029402
This is why it is important that water becomes subject to international coordination.	35.6630393602698
It has already attracted much comment, including reactions from Members of Parliament.	11.923288404664667
Here, unfortunately, the European Parliament has bowed to the interests of industry.	50.76102564540326
To this new labour market there must be a response in the programmes of tourism schools and training programmes for company staff, including programmes for training the unemployed and their re-introduction to work.	97.08026280814563
If we are going to abide by the one extreme, that is the interests of the Member States, then we certainly have every reason to make the hurdles that have to be cleared in applying for this card relatively high.	57.55568753992488
The swift action taken by this Parliament must be seen by all citizens as their greatest guarantee for the future, for you have set an agenda on food quality to which Member States must conform.	143.48607549263275
According to the Treaty, one of the founding principles of this Community is linguistic and cultural plurality and there is no question of our overlooking the possibility of something as important as being able to read a judgement in our own language.	58.081286218800315
I would also like to thank you for allowing us to sample your British sense of humour in the course of our dealings with this very difficult issue, for it makes things a little more interesting.	31.4833205796201
Lastly, I believe - and this is also the presidency' s intention - that we should continue to cooperate actively with the United Nations, given the skilful, intelligent and capable way in which the Secretary-General, and the UN organisation in general, have conducted these discussions, and in particular the way they have endeavoured to help to harmonise the two parties' positions.	66.59138799087589
At the same time, we give these countries an enormous amount of development aid.	28.02386194178659
Mr President, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism considered, amongst other things, the report on LEADER+ and, as a result, agreed to support the process of decentralisation in the management of actions, believing that that process could be effective on two conditions: that local action groups represent the general interests of the local community, and that Commission control mechanisms are utilised to prevent local and regional political authorities from using LEADER+ resources to support civil groups and organisations which are related to those authorities.	47.92516874326273
It is against just such a background that more and more people are calling for ...	164.01543106030013
Mr President, I would like to point out that I voted for this report on sustainable urban development, known as URBAN.	17.41735774651576
In an industry worth some EUR 600 billion annually, even a slight dip in confidence levels can have significant effects.	34.438707676068624
The major part of European Union aid has been provided under the TACIS programme.	53.943304405638
We must meet these challenges together.	112.84637602545884
The Commission and the Committee of Independent Experts are in favour of completely doing away with ex ante financial control.	21.02170399866738
Secondly, what does it propose to do about them?	142.3098546657916
More than one third of the 8,500 requests received meet the required conditions and it has been possible to cofinance approximately 1,300 projects between 1992 and 1998.	38.710321231730376
In this respect I have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions.	67.02062939532593
I must admit that I have my doubts about this.	12.619738362212205
I am sure that your answer to this will be "yes" but I would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be?	40.03072159871832
The Treaties provide for the European Union to help developing countries to develop but, as the previous speakers have explained so well, there are various distortions to these declarations.	56.152751618329454
For us new members, it was the first time, and this was a very interesting process.	31.615551750076243
It is incumbent on the European Union and the United Nations to address what is a social and fatal problem in a comprehensive and strategic manner.	49.64067256712863
We must do the same as far as we ourselves are concerned.	41.544300431761485
Finally, our last commitment is to improve quality of life.	50.89552005949827
These are gigantic problems but they seem to be taboo here.	59.82703721794747
I think we must do what we can to see that all Members can receive their own national channel.	24.911866470147576
He has delivered excellent work under pressure both from his colleagues and from the car industry.	81.26982955096719
There is a chemical factory in the north-west which wrote to me to say that we must vote against this legislation.	38.17601977679527
The rapporteur, Mr Koch, to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this, has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the inactivity on the part of the CEN, which has been very dilatory in drawing up and adapting the directive.	69.7212287184531
What we have here is an ecological disaster.	24.597354315409536
This was the first pillar of my recommendation.	50.07283450699286
What will happen to a place like Scotland, which I represent here?	37.78187669610173
Secondly, the doctrine of human rights must no longer be exploited, as it is today, as an instrument of ideological warfare in the hands of a cast which claims the right to decree unilaterally who is to be the arbiter of human rights and who is to be deprived of those rights, thereby denying the legitimacy and, if need be, the freedom of those whom the party line has deemed politically incorrect.	56.96538941837278
In order to give a precise answer to your question, Mr Ford, I must remind you that in order for the mechanism established by Article 7.1 of the Treaty on European Union to be applied, there must be proof of the existence and I quote, of a "serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the principles mentioned in Article 6."	21.048530042337486
You have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days, during this part-session.	38.524151087932225
We also need investment to grow at a faster rate.	120.66741005518229
It has destroyed an entire ecosystem in a matter of days.	26.035221976857372
. (FR) We did not vote against this report insofar as it contains a number of correct general principles such as the need to combat racism in the workplace and reduce inequalities between the sexes on the job market.	38.11229191522546
Coming from the border counties in the north-west of Ireland, I have seen over the years the important role which INTERREG I and II have played and I am delighted to welcome INTERREG III.	64.50157052529046
Mrs Theato has already expressed as much and I am only too willing to support her in this regard.	65.9605058944567
It is important to remember that.	17.032610641378128
As you know, we can only include five items in the 'Human Rights' section.	45.041291313425
I understand the Commission' s own concern that distance may prove detrimental to effective cooperation.	27.52868048229307
That is not how you combat racism and a swing to the right.	68.11384307630347
Let me give you three examples.	65.96522720475295
Mr President, we are having a major debate on a text of very little substance. The basic document is really no more than a Commission communication which embraces the conclusions and recommendations of a high level group on tourism and employment.	48.100468155921845
I believe that this should be applied to all areas, in particular also the budgetary area.	49.20965932526867
We risk having not too few charters of rights in this Community, but too many: national, European Union and European Convention; not too few tribunals having the final say about our rights but possibly too many - there is the Court across the river there, there is the Court in Luxembourg.	100.155578771076
I will give some examples shortly.	68.97664234347017
What we are going to vote on tomorrow is to ask the Commission to study the matter, to look at what steps and what conditions would be necessary for the introduction of such a tax.	35.83800482643696
Sort out the tangle of staff allowances.	56.080612236137355
I believe that the opening of these negotiations on the stability and association process is the logical conclusion of a salutary and positive trend in that country.	53.7469090483941
Thank you for your statement.	7.858468549399336
In its present form, what is being proposed is more like an advisory agency to the Commission rather than an independent body that would have decision- and law-making powers more similar to those of the US Food and Drug Administration, which has already established credibility in this particular field.	102.78297070822329
As an example I would give the restructuring of ABB Alsthom Power. A sizeable delegation of employees of this firm from throughout Europe is visiting Strasbourg today.	60.27837762541177
Our concern is strengthened if the rumour reported a few days ago is true - namely that the Commission wants to limit severely the access of Parliament to information.	59.72063111845886
As I say, our amendments concern transparency, and I should like to emphasise the amendment which urges the Commission to propose uniform criteria and conditions for the type of state aids we consider to be lawful, specifically in order to ensure that companies can predict what their situation will be.	45.57663683211601
There could have been deaths in this disaster and safety at sea means, above all, men' s lives.	92.6216229267968
You have not integrated it anywhere.	44.66426679634713
Finally, allow me to remind you that the third letter of the EDD Group to which I belong stands for 'difference' .	49.730938883495945
We are trying to arrange that there will be four categories for which funding is available.	29.518031690899715
Only a broadly based agreement makes any sense in practice.	100.79493281617016
What should we do with the shredded products?	28.694593988691082
However, I also agree with Mr Gallagher who felt bound to indicate his frustration at the tardiness of the Commission in getting into gear and transforming the recommendations into Community law.	40.75461841237371
Having said that, governing means planning. It also means being responsible and, in this new context which has been forced upon us, competition law naturally has an essential role to play.	62.472271986330675
We are concerned about stability on the financial markets, not for the sake of the financial markets, but because this has to do with own growth, our own investments and our own jobs in the European Union.	33.47973226429982
In that event we would not have moved forward, but rather backwards, in the application of competition policy in the Union.	28.616915108752828
Lastly, I would like to state once again that the Commission intends to be in the pole position in presenting proposals for implementing the Treaty of Amsterdam.	29.991420738263866
As indicated by the rapporteur, we are discussing probably one of the most important issues that we will ever have to discuss in this Parliament.	29.419496456329007
Indeed, the comments which have just been made express a proactive attitude and a concern which match his own: the Portuguese Presidency cannot be just an interim presidency.	102.43809903957231
Mr President, the Commissioner said that Turkey has signed the non-proliferation treaty, it has signed the nuclear safety treaties: why should there be any doubt at all but that Turkey's nuclear plant should not be just as safe as any in the Community, and would the Commissioner be prepared to take a rather more robust position with Mr Souladakis on this matter?	92.71650350739733
For me there is no question of allowing them to develop and to flourish without fighting with all our might.	54.82644229018687
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group cannot vote for approving the accounts for 1997.	21.77975754007946
Everyone is free to hold such views.	39.466765454000424
These dossiers will be progressed by the Transport Council and I can therefore assure you, on behalf of the Council, that we will not fail to give the highest priority to the proposals, which there is every indication the Commission is due to present in this area, which we regard as being a vital part of environmental protection.	48.260227843723136
The same applies to the Commission and I would again like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his collaboration with the European Parliament and for the very constructive proposals he put before us.	24.548207329474494
If this is true, and it is, any appropriate policy which aims to find positive solutions to these problems must start from this point.	60.00515376599622
This message is contained in the excellent report by Mr Andersson.	39.800019994095564
This is natural elsewhere but it seems to be an extremely radical suggestion when it is put to the Commission.	27.637546856221487
I would also point out that our coordinator on the Budgetary Control Committee is Mr Pomés Ruiz, who is Spanish and has hence made a major contribution to this debate from a Spanish perspective.	58.71756917398871
But do you envisage that the Food Safety Agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and France's refusal to lift the ban?	70.943253644632
Joint motion for a resolution on the negotiations to form a government in Austria	51.9658226618002
The spread of an epidemic as the result of bringing in one sick animal can have huge consequences for farmers.	91.80551244257887
However, my criticism - and I freely admit this - my rage, is directed exclusively against those who have provoked these reactions and continue to do so, Messrs Schüssel and Haider and their parties, ...	43.44348174491459
I was wondering whether this is the correct procedure.	30.200198681665753
From the point of view of the Macedonian majority, the Albanian minority behaved loyally towards the common state during the international explosion of the Kosovo conflict.	34.938507543085535
I commend Mr Florenz, Mr Lange and others who have sought from both sides of the party divide a compromise based on shared costs.	27.407245665188498
In the last 30 years, the volume of currency transactions has increased by 83 times: firstly, total global reserves of all central banks barely amounts to one day of foreign exchange trading; secondly, annual global trade in real goods and services equals just three-and-a-half days of foreign exchange markets out of 350, that is, 1% of capital movements are for trade in goods and services and 99% are for speculation.	79.83293718802817
The figures will be more reliable and more comparable and I think the concerns some Members have raised about compliance with the stability pact can be better addressed.	29.825811075784273
Such pressures are greatest in Europe.	28.677934320086752
I would therefore ask the Commissioner: can you not in fact do anything to stop us repeating our follies here in Europe?	33.95175763801469
I would first of all like to say that I am very pleased with the contributions made by Mr Patten and the Minister, and I welcome the fact that both China and Cuba are on the agenda.	24.00608273775131
The contribution that the projects supported by LIFE make to the sustainability of social and economic activities, and thus job creation.	80.06198906365489
A ceiling of 700 has been prescribed as the maximum that Parliament can safely become and remain a deliberative assembly.	119.66083649708561
The subject of the statement that I have the honour of presenting to you today, is the coherence of different Union policies with development policy.	40.20946093260308
As the UK business grew, we invested in more people, as the Dutch business grew we invested in more machinery.	58.82973163097372
Is the Commission ready to suspend funding completely, pending a review of the development plans of the area?	53.71853683953933
This partisan behaviour of our President should be criticised most firmly.	55.2839512331006
Mr President, first of all let me say that I am in full support of a statute for assistants.	21.404185919290494
That will develop very quickly and present the various undertakings in our society with new challenges; we will have to adapt very flexibly and rapidly to these challenges.	155.05757306062316
But let us stop to consider the circumstances in which this debate is taking place and the conclusions to which it should bring us.	99.61743215051425
I shall not repeat all the various statements he made at his hearing, I think we all still remember them.	51.2303615053379
If we stretched our imaginations, we could envisage a situation where, between now and next summer, an oil tanker may run aground under similar circumstances off the Algarve, wreck the Portuguese summer tourist industry, with a bit of luck the sea currents would carry the pollution towards the island of Madeira - because they move in that direction - and furthermore, wreck tourism in the Canary Islands as well.	84.93038801401092
Thank you, Commissioner Kinnock.	9.580779858566327
As described this afternoon it will go a long way towards drowning out some of the unpleasant tunes we heard during the European election and over the last few months.	41.209658952577705
Human rights do not exist in isolation, they are connected to our development policies, our economic policies, our home affairs policies, indeed they are at the very heart of our democratic functions.	45.5618680329418
The European Union underlined its full support for the efforts of the United Nations on the need for a tribunal to prosecute former Khmer Rouge leaders.	25.27889549667108
Mr Prodi secured positive comments for a proposal which would otherwise have been met with criticism, for the new draft regulation presents as progress the fact that it will now be possible to grant right of access to documents in the Commission' s possession. There follows, however, a long, long list of exceptions, and there is legal entitlement to confidentiality in regard to those exceptions.	54.44147596825886
I have classified the issues raised by the honourable Members into four groups.	34.02659093310638
Over the coming months, that is to say during the Portuguese Presidency, this debate will of course be enriched by the contributions that the Commission has undertaken to present to us.	27.316945751693968
I do not expect that the board will have any function in directing the scientists how to do their work.	73.75549674772658
We are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a Europe of Citizens and not just in a Europe of States and of Regions.	40.15527612987456
Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission.	4.3646959438647555
Allow me also - listen carefully to what I am saying now, because I have heard this reiterated in the debate - allow me to comment on the issue of vintage and "cherished" cars as mentioned in Amendments Nos 3, 7, and 9, section 2, and 35.	31.078966245552536
From the outside, it looks as if the Commission has something to hide.	134.29763377694783
From what I have seen of the reform process, it looks good.	50.529240056324554
Thank you, Commissioner Monti.	18.704013847425315
It is obvious to me that the regional and local authorities, and their representative bodies, the Committee of the Regions and, of course, the European Parliament should have been involved in the clearest way possible and at the earliest possible opportunity framing this programme.	32.6761317838379
I would like to emphasise the strong political message sent out by the European Council, reaffirming the importance that the Heads of State and Government of the Union attached to a fundamental project, together with various political guidelines and priorities which will turn this area into a reality, following a progressive strategy, within a time-frame of five years, and that, above all, the three components of this area should be in balance: freedom, security and justice.	48.48030911274634
In concrete terms, 3 000 tonnes represent 57.5% of Portugal' s fishing opportunities in 2000 against 5 008 tonnes or 73.9% in 1999.	59.79909153015365
You could hardly expect this Commissioner to agree with a tax which would, in fact, impede international economic movement.	103.86884477954096
That means, making a European bugging system like the transatlantic spying operation 'Echelon' perfectly legal.	46.61767590495043
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Verheugen, the regulation on accession aid is not exactly an advertisement for coherent work on the part of the Commission.	24.25271136003098
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.	2.5403445224446473
These two considerations are diametrically opposed to each other, and I really fail to grasp how such a proposal can end up on the table.	78.58974352798859
Please support the Austrian people against this government!	49.70567130608373
This could just as well be 0% - the internal market would still be harmonised.	132.73200277848008
Although such measures can never be an alternative for good management, they must be an escape valve when something goes wrong.	81.85964937784193
Once again, there will be no clearly defined party responsible.	47.333850956211066
Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way, the Commission has, on a number of occasions, authorised aid for the steel industry even though such aid did not fall within the categories set out in the code.	12.482365533349968
In that area, there have been various policies from time to time, and what the European Union should guard against is the risk that, for ultimately superficial reasons, it may help to create banana republics elsewhere.	37.00483517048107
That is the agenda and I think that we should stick to the agenda.	20.52150997407881
However, we must remember that the public opinion of 370 million people in the European Union is a vital factor in changing the EU treaties.	32.195168319518636
The debate is closed.	4.222752763164861
In addition, investors often have better protection with an actively-managed fund.	76.90796821298417
The next item is the report (A5-0022/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision providing exceptional Community financial assistance to Kosovo (COM(99)0598 - C5-0045/00 - 1999/0240(CNS)).	2.103988579992949
I hope this is not an omen for this Sintra Agreement.	26.49529618528755
Accordingly, the bureaucratic hurdles that have to be overcome would be lower in this instance.	56.060010831337806
At the same time, the European Parliament created a new heading: 'pre-accession strategy for Mediterranean countries' (B7-04), under which two new articles were created for the pre-accession strategy for Malta and Cyprus pending the Commission' s presentation, following the Helsinki European Council, of the necessary legal bases and a review of the ceiling for heading 7 of the Financial Perspectives.	35.67742527667824
I think it is important for the unions too to operate under uniform economic and social framework conditions so as to achieve the best results for their members on a basis of justice, fairness and solidarity.	57.4393065581959
I cannot accept this.	18.047281901826146
This does not apply to all farming in developing countries but to the poverty-focusing which we need to deliver better than so far.	46.657752539294094
Speaking in this House on 21 July President-designate Prodi undertook to take full account of the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on Commission reform, which contains 90 detailed recommendations and which we are debating today.	39.342051415993836
But these days, we are witnessing the exact reverse before our very eyes.	81.67155581685707
However, I cannot accept the wording of the consideration as it stands.	45.985514752704596
We need to look very carefully at those.	79.14080350191563
My only regret is that my own commitment to open the European Reconstruction Agency on Monday meant that I could not take part myself in that trip to the Middle East, even though, as I mentioned earlier in the day - which is another story - events conspired to maroon me at Munich airport rather than transport me to Thessaloniki.	42.55455083178496
The views I shall express today are not far removed from those I had then.	114.4503068851212
. As regards the Commission's position with respect to the amendments tabled by Parliament I wish to confirm what my colleague stated during the debate in this House on Tuesday, 15 February.	34.34146919176701
I think Mr Swoboda has drafted an excellent report, and it has my wholehearted support.	77.1837118508919
We therefore await, and I await, the European Commission' s proposals on this matter.	35.377805259220565
Madame McNally, in general, I am myself rather concerned at the increasing number of problems we are having with the translations.	66.76429410635188
I think that Mrs Lienemann' s proposal is a good basis for further negotiations with the Council.	14.132282330819104
In our view, this would bring with it a complex legislative burden, and it would be preferable to have a political and declaratory charter which explains to citizens what their existing rights are.	112.52494219400556
That system has proved itself to be inappropriate because it is, in actual fact, of use only to relatively few of the 71 countries concerned.	53.63642917455489
Therefore, the issues of the reversed burden of proof and of what the burden of proof is to look like are not especially discussed in this context. Instead, it is a question of political decision-making and of the bases for this.	63.538136497964175
We expect to dedicate a considerable sum to improving the healthcare system.	46.29965766529448
However, I could also regard them as a customer, and I believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the ways in which the social field, that is evolved structures, stifle competition.	46.65423611786623
Will the Council say just simply yes or no to it or will it be in a position to actually then redraft that draft Charter?	60.15794703780363
What is more, the Portuguese Presidency sees the fight against unemployment as top priority.	31.44215124055679
Women are not participating in political parties and in the working and social world at a level of fifty per cent.	100.0811362181753
It is also necessary to exercise authority as closely as possible to the citizens, where it can be exercised with due transparency and can be monitored by the citizens themselves.	69.97076949228898
The European Parliament has already taken a clear stand on BSE and I think that we should do likewise on all epidemics in animals.	31.335852270646182
This is a very important social debate in the creation of a European area in which the right to freedom, security and justice will be recognised in the future Charter of Fundamental Rights.	19.113219157577216
At the same time we must not lose sight of the Palestinian track.	12.75342605149133
Commissioner, I want to go back to one of your previous answers. In this you mentioned what I would refer to as the possibilities of protecting the EU Treaty against any risks of deviation and, in particular, the variation of penalties which may be imposed on a Member State, pursuant to Article 7, for the violation of fundamental freedoms.	70.26231156717398
It should be pointed out that this can only be done within the Council' s scope for action.	17.503425437093018
Before discussing the content of the resolution, I should like to inform you of the elements which I took account of and which guided my work as rapporteur.	68.50056755327353
The Office is not yet ready to move into the new building.	81.54489768638429
I thus believe that Mr Schulz could have spared himself the effort of making certain remarks.	59.17870533288649
Questions will be asked - questions which I shall have to put to you and the Commission representatives in committee - on how things stand with the BSE status of the Member States and other third countries.	81.27960646748201
But at the mid-way point or end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful.	99.31002154586305
We are basically well disposed towards the European Union.	28.23483294351337
By having the opportunity to show their true merit, by eliminating as far as possible the barriers associated to the specifics of their condition as women, and not in the context of a conflict in which women seem to be attacking male privilege, women will demonstrate the benefits to be gained by facilitating a situation where their professional careers may flourish. In this way they will succeed in altering balances which are still not in their favour.	62.56317704428662
My last point concerns the future Palestinian State.	43.75113518040171
We agree that they ought to be indicative in nature, allowing the maximum flexibility to ensure that we target specific programmes.	45.97711516698574
We also need a code of corporate conduct to make sure that companies in fact work in partnership with their workers in the management of change.	111.15759678905788
Someone planted a car bomb and one person has died.	140.9692130178053
Human rights and civil liberties are inextricably linked.	136.37394333903552
We also presented a proposal for a decision on combating fraud and forgery of non-cash means of payment.	42.077260279006765
These impact studies are necessary in order to assess the effects of any untrammelled liberalisation, not just on the economic organisation of the market, but also in terms of its human and social aspects.	52.87415180054644
We look forward to reading the full Commission proposal on reform and we look forward to working out the detail alongside the Commission because, unlike what Mr Elles has just said, the Commissioner has made a commitment to discuss it with Parliament between now and 1 March.	62.83571627628825
But the need for common legislation is underlined by the fact that in the Netherlands they have liberalised, in Germany they have not, yet German companies which enjoy the protection of national law seek to take market share in the Netherlands.	57.664740674657416
We need to get ourselves into a position of conciliation.	41.844459937137415
80 percent of it was landed by purse seine.	72.02777978689716
We had high winds and unprecedented, prolonged rainfall which, adding to existing difficulties, resulted in thousands of acres being submerged, sometimes, in up to 15 feet of water.	43.117206943021365
As for the budgetary provisions within the Member States, between central government and internal autonomous regions or countries, these are determined according to exclusively national considerations and are therefore not affected by additionality within the meaning defined in the rules.	40.60208748834048
That appeared in the communication published last July.	98.94846980702826
But this is not in place.	36.74085316587634
Codecision and unanimity do not go hand in hand.	11.978880832513157
I remain worried about the whole operation of the judicial process.	21.840788893469647
It demonstrates one of the main flaws in the European Union, a little-known, almost always implicit flaw, but one which goes a long way towards explaining our citizens' loss of interest.	49.611506891561106
The car lobby has led too many people up the garden path.	76.7416464063155
Do you really believe that, if we could, Parliament would permit labelling to be left off feedingstuff additives within the European Union?	23.519981162045884
We have high hopes for what you will achieve.	222.14936854145014
In addition, there is a special provision of up to EUR 50 million for Greece.	30.655053169882684
I have even submitted four amendments on behalf of my group that largely relate to the correct way of quoting Council decisions.	37.55743910354786
It is nothing less than hypocritical to condemn the flagrant violation of human rights that occurs in non-EU countries if we are not prepared to extend a helping hand to those genuine refugees and asylum-seekers, whose position is now becoming more difficult in the EU.	28.81189966395216
On the other hand, we think it is important - and this is also linked with the way in which the European Union relates to the heart of this matter - that an exchange of information between the Commission and the Cypriots in the north of the island should be encouraged. This would not, let me make this quite clear, imply any kind of formal recognition.	30.368572222738862
The elections to the European Parliament in 1999 showed perfectly clearly that the people of Europe do not fall in with the notion of an ever more federalist EU centred upon Brussels.	34.42161642303459
The nature of the EU has not changed.	116.19488217653343
(The sitting was closed at 8.14 p.m.)	3.1164827669084763
We were talking a short while ago in this House about debates involving our citizens, about public debates.	46.920866883189426
This transparency is also very important for the unions, for how can a union official who has to represent his members in a private company compete with a union official who has to represent his members in the postal service?	115.02375672327983
The Commission has the same opinion of similar amendments to the second proposal.	60.810300793981135
Firstly, these relate to the coherence of the policy' s application.	40.259216228094985
You did not fully answer the last part of my question on large-scale energy transmission networks.	19.124673236712002
Finally, we urge the European Parliament, both sides of industry and social NGOs to be closely involved in this process.	43.57072518304106
Whether or not the money will come onto the equity market in the form of direct investment or via UCITS is not relevant here.	64.65789750045865
Cambodia	21.908902300206645
The FPÖ party is established in Austria' s political landscape.	79.68314505089695
He stressed a number of points, with which we may indicate our agreement, as many of you did too - the importance of this trans-European cooperation, with its three strands, cross-border, transnational, interregional; the added value to the Community provided by INTERREG, its clarity in relation to the general framework of the structural funds, and the truly cross-border and transnational strengthening of eligible programmes and operations; the importance of common structures and what, in discussing another debate which begins today, the Intergovernmental Conference, I termed the common European spirit which we have to strengthen, and here, with INTERREG, thanks to INTERREG, is a way to strengthen common spirit through common structures for the implementation of programmes with real financial solidarity; the importance of partnership in guaranteeing the active participation of all the local and regional authorities concerned as well as private sector associations and economic and social partners.	60.432094736007876
They are having to choose, for example, between reducing taxes or reducing the public deficit, but clearly avoiding any price rises, or - so there is no misunderstanding - creating a special reserve for future situations in which welfare may be needed, given the EU' s population growth.	42.19221636752211
B5-0168/2000 by Mr Oostlander and Mrs Grossetête on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats,	8.642495994763012
Thank you, Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, I should like to assure you of my empathy and sincere respect.	25.161149791283403
Let me begin by specifying precisely what we are debating. Article 178, Title XX of the consolidated Treaties of the European Union reads as follows: "The Community shall take account of the objectives referred to in Article 177 in the policies that it implements which are likely to affect developing countries" .	26.556958580445354
Agreement was reached in 1988 in the form of an exchange of letters between Lord Plumb and Mr Delors.	58.4343125054821
No more than EUR 2.8 billion is provided for EQUAL, as Mrs Stenzel' s balanced report makes clear.	59.42358041703969
It must be visible.	12.25647876201078
Echelon is one of many examples of this, giving an image of Europe that is quite different to the one we like to envisage here.	96.50996524194362
1997 was a matter for the old Commission and, therefore, the new Commission does not think that it can accept liability.	57.13969424695425
We should counter such acts of terror, Mr President, by setting up a parliamentary committee of inquiry as quickly as possible so that we can decide how we can succeed in preventing other conflicts of a similar nature elsewhere. My fellow Member, Mrs Roure, was right to remind us just now that we all need to put our own house in order.	29.313296338884836
It means taking a very hard look at how the use of internal and external resources can be most effectively balanced in the interest of the Union.	63.226520311220376
Yet we do not have much time.	10.390951321329132
This debate does in fact give us an excellent opportunity, Mr Byrne, to give the Commission a few things to think about.	81.49762228589799
We know that the Commission proposal does not go far enough; unfortunately this also applies to the proposal by the Committee on the Environment.	19.703178083105342
These amendments can all be approved.	135.9079372434189
They will need time to get used to that too.	103.81004269493332
This does not conflict with a financing model involving the building up of funds.	77.43187466499005
Mr President, Commissioner, the new attitude adopted recently by the Commission on this important economic activity is striking to those of us who, in recent years, have kept an eye on tourism and its place in the Community framework.	37.773003906646025
This cannot be done, and it also, in any case, goes against nature.	46.427124294803924
This is even more important given that there is no clear proof that BSE and scrapie are unrelated.	35.45922906920971
Secondly, there is compulsory cooperation.	103.90893413542467
That has not been done in Ireland although a certain liberalisation has taken place and has not been impeded by the national government.	54.57375660547185
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	5.536307625563325
We have often employed instruments which, at the formal level, make us feel comfortable, but which, in terms of practical results, are totally ineffectual.	60.73280816682671
An urgent request has been referred to us, and we approve it.	182.67997220983534
UCITS are a success story within the European Union.	45.089972785726665
I have just been writing a report before I came to this job, and writing a very good report, just to respond to my honourable friend, on policing in part of my own country.	52.7439480593932
Secondly, I would like to explode a myth, taking as a starting point an apparent paradox, which is clearly highlighted by Eurostat figures: the main international tourist countries are not those traditionally regarded as tourist destinations, but on the contrary the most advanced nations, whose quality of life is one of their main attractions and most heavily promoted features.	24.632625330765954
We should, however, also bear in mind, Mr Papayannakis, that we cannot act in an area which will have such a big financial impact, armed only with the measures a presidency can propose in the space of six months.	88.2326767440015
Where is the sense of crisis which generations before us had?	40.360400269846316
Since then, Community VAT fraud and distortions in the calculation of GDP, the taxable basis for the fourth resource, have had a perceptible effect on the yield and justice of Community resources.	70.00260721214023
This is important in the interests of transparency and the overall effectiveness of networks.	74.43734387230661
The fact that the Syrian Foreign Minister and the Israeli Prime Minister were recently sitting around the same table in America for the first time in their respective histories is an indication that old hatreds and animosities can be overcome.	30.49991544015592
It is this dual challenge that the Commission has to take up, by framing in the months ahead a proposal for a general policy statement.	36.85271006274169
Europe must prove - in the Balkans and the rest of the world - its ability to extend the area of security, peace and freedom and its ability to take a leading role on the international stage.	25.038890496182624
We had a regional debate in Nassau in the Caribbean and this was extremely productive.	94.59446290164803
Only the background level of the ocean is acceptable.	183.82914553352316
Not only has he admired Adolf Hitler, praised the Waffen SS, and refused to condemn a terrorist bombing that killed four Roma, but also in Carinthia has been a member of the regional government.	34.66096563780121
I think there are some gaps in what they have put forward.	22.580516023214003
Will the Council treat it as a document that it has to accept as it stands, or will the Council feel free to amend that document?	59.72605870051781
Those are three reasons for a common foreign and security policy and we will be tested on how successful a common foreign and security policy we develop above all by how we handle things in the Balkans and do not lose sight of the fact that there are quite a few of our critics, quite a few American politicians, quite a few senators and congressmen who say 'How can we possibly take you seriously in developing a common foreign and security policy when you cannot even handle problems on your own back doorstep?' .	30.70905446507116
These will consist of everything from insurance to sensible and effective scrapping and recycling systems.	56.03259292189629
Finally, we ask that the Commission ensures that Structural Fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent.	60.44243547927941
Mr Prodi, there is one positive thing that I would like to say to you, perhaps contrary to the opinion of some Members, regarding the telegram that you sent to the Austrian Government.	35.17156455183977
An important question in this context is the future distribution of water.	72.07192721702076
So, judicially, something needs to be done.	10.100172031666094
I sincerely hope, in conclusion, that social Europe cannot be satisfied with mere words and pious hopes.	94.89952096547225
Mr President, firstly I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my colleague, Mr van Hulten.	18.35254460427294
The Commission is prepared to look at the possibility of making an introduction to gender and development, part of the so-called induction courses for new staff, something that has been done already but not, I admit, on a regular basis.	56.98347028443894
They have been living in harrowing living conditions for years.	32.36320307235791
We cannot afford to make a mistake, for we know for a fact that we shall not be able to turn the clock back and that in the event of an imbalance, the firm will know how to tackle it: jobs will be lost, services will be reduced, the dead wood will be removed and we already know which areas will be considered dead wood.	86.25690810093079
Have the Council of Fisheries Ministers and the Commission assessed the impact of transferring the Portuguese quota for ICES zones XI and X and CECAF zone 34.1.1 to France (5000 metric tonnes per year overfishing) on the ICES zone VIII anchovy stocks and their responsibility for the current situation of the anchovy stocks and the possible social and economic impact on this fisheries sector in the future?	48.86307651222651
Rapkay Report (A5-0078/1999)	19.131290519811884
This type of procedure is common practice since the programmes or legislative measures are too often allocated budgets which do not live up to their ambitions!	58.627325478023856
Mr President, Commissioner, I think we need this directive.	20.97114617199472
In accordance with the principle of relative stability, 90% of stocks of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay are allocated to Spain and only 10% to France.	29.586490390317977
Mr President, I understand that I have to do this very quickly.	64.1215651664517
Madam President, I had a major problem with this resolution.	46.00362377976154
If nothing helpful is forthcoming in the course of a parliamentary debate planned for clarification and orientation, then we must at least abstain from voting.	21.808689430309503
Perhaps this is a little worrying.	45.26483191465447
One of the most significant transfers - the Tajo-Segura transfer - which has been in use for many years, almost 30 years, has an allowance of 658 hm3 per year.	63.7705478836057
We should be tackling the issue of immigration in a comprehensive and rigorous manner.	78.85694739609256
One attempts to ensure that the data sought are no more detailed than necessary to serve the objective being pursued.	77.04083457774249
The international community including the United States of America, Switzerland, South Africa, Ireland, Norway, Denmark, Italy, Sweden and the Netherlands have to date provided substantial assistance.	12.711778394431317
I should therefore like to draw your attention in particular to the inclusion of increased numbers of vocational training measures, especially in areas with high levels of long-term and youth unemployment.	46.56291091424754
This is a decision of national and local government, and this is where all future decisions should be retained.	79.82705230220542
Has the Greek Government introduced any changes so as to extend the scope of partnership arrangements to the local authorities and other representative bodies?	72.25925260739257
This can be prevented if a European social model is drawn up and if results are achieved in all these concrete areas.	71.59744584909583
This technology can facilitate that necessary quantum leap forward in development policy to which I referred and, in this connection, the EU can set the agenda, leave its mark on development and honour its global responsibilities.	73.30332671042822
This fine balance must be struck in conjunction with the Commission, and not by the Commission on its own. In most countries where the Commission is active, development aid is also granted by the Member States themselves.	58.02334314948916
We are prepared to consider re-weighting the votes in the Council of Ministers, provided that the larger Member States are willing to agree to every Member State having a full and equal Member of the Commission.	25.87759658319779
Mr President, my starting point is the EQUAL report and equality between men and women, although I must admit that it is sometimes hard to talk about this issue, which has a feeling of déjà vu about it when you are my age, in any case.	71.03694625695292
This is very sensible because key economic and social difficulties in our country cannot be overcome unless there is key integration between national, European and local funding.	53.510061142754175
The European Union needs to recognise that when such drastic decisions are taken against conflicting scientific evidence submitted by the fishermen themselves, which have been totally rejected out of hand, for the conservation of their own fish stocks, then serious trouble can only result when these men are not heard.	40.51161501225195
The Commission would be able to determine the choice of legal basis by excluding any reference to health policy and we would suddenly find ourselves up against an Article 37.	78.00336444709495
We believe in 'one man, one vote' more than 'one share, one vote' .	51.231648192008
Having said that, I thought your question related more to the partnership issue.	45.544981855429086
Finally, but no less importantly, I would like to refer to the rapporteur' s proposal that, in future, this type of report should also include, amongst other issues, an analysis of the way cohesion is developing between the regions within each State.	60.10605528288183
As all colleagues will know - and many of you have approached me over the last six months - all exhibitions and such like are filtered first of all through the Comart committee of Parliament.	79.4597419368655
We also need stricter criteria for interpreting the results of any monitoring.	45.68215416343145
He has been clear that his commitment has been to produce a radical change.	148.37457368804434
We think it is wrong to talk about the Commission' s liability as an institution.	49.03944222438796
The year 2000 also marks the start of the implementation of the European Union Drugs Strategy 2000-2004.	34.05642587923016
Mr President, I want to thank you for your answer. I want to ask a follow-up question which bears some resemblance to the one Mr Sjöstedt asked.	29.130256474042618
It is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not anonymous.	44.81321887863962
Finally, Mr Prodi' s complacency towards the Austrian Government in the name of an exaggerated sense of protocol (which in no way obliges him to send a message of congratulations) would in itself warrant a vote of no confidence.	63.587279764626054
I must also stress that once again the Commission is, in fact, skirting the issue of practical action on equal opportunities.	56.678503540954694
Mr President, the principle of universal human rights is undoubtedly one of the most important political legacies of the 20th century.	32.47653575089125
In some cases, I get the impression that it is not about solidarity or alleviating the most desperate problems, but about propaganda and upholding vested interests in exchange for the European Union' s blessing.	32.148400832385455
There is no proposal to change that and under the proposed new regime there is no question of diseased fish being sold.	99.62824539105353
I have already said that the authority will be charged with developing networks with national food safety agencies and bodies in the Member States.	19.542714859161727
It seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves.	75.08017785816064
Restrictions on fundamental rights cannot and must not be applied to the field of law unless they are justified in that they are associated with an actual or presumed violation of criminal law.	39.639369704075364
I would therefore like to call on the Presidency of Parliament to consider that it might be appropriate for the Presidency itself to invite the Members to do likewise.	42.812320289034
The use of biotechnology needs to be studied in greater depth and not just "packaged" for immediate sale to boost the profits of a few multinationals in this sector.	72.89768159436917
These are serious matters on which this House must act.	117.58811953224578
The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is in favour of increasing this amount to EUR 850 million.	11.802546789952808
We are very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible.	27.82686689884171
The proof of this lies in the fact that the groups in this House have reacted and tabled several motions for resolutions.	25.554778067394658
The voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous.	33.724273375751345
Furthermore, Amendment No 43 does not fall within the directive' s area of applicability.	13.585012022723422
- (SV) We have voted in favour of the common resolution in order to express our solidarity with all those who are exposed to xenophobia and racism.	25.934050339391725
If there is a choice between investing in innovation projects or injecting most of the funding into bringing on deprived areas, we would opt for the latter as this does the most to benefit equality.	39.74128648028167
Regarding the many adjectival descriptions of Europe you addressed in your speech - an energetic Europe, an enterprising Europe, a Europe that has a human face and is inclusive - let me, in a word dear to the heart of my Liberal colleagues, give in one adjective, one description of the kind of Europe we want to see in your plan for governance: an enabling Europe.	57.648146183481664
I can only say very briefly, that we are actively working with them on a practical level: they are making preparations, they now all have competition laws and are setting up the relevant authorities.	103.34370266765109
But we feel that there is a legal obligation for a proposal to be made.	33.28153139158262
Gender has in fact been included in the compulsory introductory course for new employees, but then with only one to two hours devoted to it on each course.	74.2534137407048
Occasionally for some people the postman is the only person they see all day.	82.88324426483572
First, because Mr Sakellariou, who is known for his openness and tolerance and whom I shall not quote, vehemently vetoed it in a bid to set himself up as your moral defender.	45.820138466329844
We need a system which provides incentives and promotion and we need to see this promotion based on merit.	47.910824485457454
That should amply compensate them for forgoing their contact with the postman.	115.80193694265746
The sending of data is completely voluntary and failure to do so will only mean that certain financial assistance, which is not very significant anyway, will not be received.	73.7067649651182
Let us learn the lessons of the past.	21.612885564869835
Mr President, Commissioner, the adoption of the WIPO agreements was a very positive step in the direction of the global information society.	26.019256907502307
The European Union will continue discussions on preparations for the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission at the next meeting of the Human Rights Group in March.	21.63740252795209
For as Mr Langen said just now, we certainly had a tough fight on our hands in the Conciliation Committee.	85.41160047322315
Of course we need to aim high, but quotas must not become an end in themselves.	34.74331359585908
He must also know whether his bag of protein granules includes GMOs as these components could represent a risk to public health.	57.26058586011116
These are four goals which have been worded in such broad terms that everyone must be able to support them. Having a group of high-ranking officials as the focal point for the pooling of experience and for the coordination and evaluation of the ways in which social and labour market policies are being developed is also something we can all benefit from.	72.41300693120768
People react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a crust.	96.54923981995249
It is a very clear answer, but it is also an answer, may I point out, which puts Danish organisations, the Danish Government and the Danish Parliament in a very, very difficult situation politically, for it is a well-known fact that there are a number of basic problems associated with the relationship between the Danish model, which is based quite obviously upon collective agreements, and the Continental model, which presupposes legislation.	36.147894986724474
It should be noted that the current regulation on social security systems does not at present refer to the question of early retirement and the Commission has proposed certain amendments to the regulation which are, however, still pending before the Council.	40.24928594362478
This is all I am talking about here, just that.	34.38290741937877
It was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis.	37.565123161962994
Mr President, I would like to use the few seconds of speaking time to which I am entitled to point out, or remind, the representative of the Commission that, in Belgium, the government is currently pursuing a policy under which thousands and possibly tens of thousands of illegal aliens are being legalised and are to receive permanent right of residence, right to be reunited with their families, etc.	56.18107218966047
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, following the same line as Mrs Maij-Weggen, I believe that we have a number of representatives here who all feel passionate about contributing to this debate.	20.666427689063177
Community policy in the field of water	10.234440006713456
I am not forgetting, and we cannot forget, that 80% of the citizens of Europe today live in towns and that is why this URBAN instrument is extremely important.	44.1592473595076
I would not want you to be birds of ill omen, but I fear that, by failing to confront the real issue, you will end up being just that and I shall hold you entirely responsible for what may happen.	75.6197672898509
Ambition will be needed, given the mammoth task which awaits us.	46.30910026660976
It is vital that when violations are committed, the perpetrators should not be able to act with impunity, whoever or wherever they may be - in Indonesia or Angola, in Cuba, China or Burma, whether the perpetrators are civilians or soldiers, humble foot-soldier or general or even a minister.	55.30777384838502
Could you please make sure that French-speaking Members of this House know that the word entreprises is not correct.	35.196511892828
Secondly, even if the Commission and the Council adopt a different position on this because they see real problems there, we believe that the other donors must also fulfil the obligations they have entered into.	75.49143748201311
I would nevertheless like to say, with regard to the rights of the child, that we consider this to be an extremely topical issue, particularly for the Council of Europe and in view of the existence of a set of relevant international texts to which we have signed up.	25.393146607536135
The crux of the problem is that all governments, and indeed all the European institutions, acknowledge the right of major corporations such as Total-Fina and its ilk to maximise profits whether it be harmful to their employees or to the environment.	62.11994779699606
While in theory this may meet the need for concentration and therefore the efficiency of interventions, we cannot help wondering whether the current situation of the Objective 1 zones allows, in practice, a policy of integrated interventions, for which an operational instrument to coordinate the appropriations is necessary.	114.44588388516105
(The sitting was suspended at 1.55 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.)	2.3905279171352807
I hope that Turkey begins to play a constructive role in the Cyprus issue.	25.99803496920059
Parliament is not taking the initiative and supporting a Tobin type tax just to annoy the Commission.	100.43369825298595
We are not as enthusiastic about compromising as Mrs Frassoni.	61.95497924896615
We shall proceed to vote on the PPE-DE Group' s request that the oral question regarding the capital tax be withdrawn from the agenda.	51.295885280555744
We need to deploy the energies of the unemployed, the underused skills of youth and the experience of age to tackle these problems.	151.79145988921601
As you all know, this convention was the result of many years of discussion, which was often difficult and often laborious, and that for this very reason, it represents a compromise between unitary and territorial principles, that is to say, the structural principles of the different legal insolvency proceedings in each of our Member States.	101.27029641342065
The size, unpredictability and irrationality of the global foreign exchange markets have made it harder and harder to manage national and regional economies.	67.03339054109036
You can only farm if you have an adequate supply of clean water.	36.526215428128545
Naturally, sensible safeguards are required to protect specially sensitive information, but the cases where these are needed should be kept to the minimum possible.	70.83235820510978
I therefore appeal to the German delegates in particular to prevent major political damage occurring today!	34.01046488058674
In this respect, I fully support the amendments proposed by Mrs Lienemann to develop a reasonable approach using quality standards so that we can eventually say that, when people use water, they are not consuming it but maintaining present stocks.	31.874501821569368
In the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach in Austria.	8.596008102084538
Who will be next, quite literally, for the chop?	32.414764341023236
We shall therefore vote cautiously on all amendments limiting recourse to excessively derivative instruments and we shall vote in favour of all amendments which limit the excessive concentration of assets within a single financial group.	45.3202455814834
Since 4 July 1990, when Cyprus applied to join the EU, the European Parliament has passed numerous resolutions calling for a political solution in accordance with international law and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations.	42.97036452714637
No one wants an unimpeded subsidy competition in Europe.	56.64459982115959
We are not mad. What we have done is to work long and hard, with determination and, without a shadow of a doubt, with the support not only of yourselves but also of the Heads of State and Government of the countries which you represent.	38.642466333531715
You said earlier in your speech that a disaster such as that of the Danube is an example of the need for an emergency structure; no, Mr Prodi, we need, at long last, to start transposing legislation and ensuring that legislation is monitored.	48.94554424856705
For example, Mrs Maij-Weggen referred to both Indonesia and Burma and made some important points about both those countries and the human rights situation there.	158.267873172644
It is therefore with great satisfaction that we welcome the proposal that is now being made for a stabilisation and association agreement with Macedonia, and we thank Mr Swoboda for a very good report.	35.360401135857586
Commissioner Barnier, you laid great stress in your statement on the importance of dialogue with the citizens of Europe.	36.38010716323917
Our role should be to accompany, reassure and assist those who are fleeing dictatorships.	22.922703745805226
Mr President, on behalf of Commission President, Mr Prodi, I would like to respond as follows.	25.588422051031337
It is quite the opposite.	15.351614592706296
In our opinion, the Commission' s role in the near future will be dependent on some of the European political initiative being returned by the governments of the Member States following the Santer Commission scandal.	36.037895762788736
Some have different sectors and, in view of the volume of data to be sent, could be prejudiced compared with those which have a smaller volume of data, if the same deadlines are set.	76.32604577604614
State interference in the economy is, even today, still to blame for the most serious hindrances placed in the way of the market, competition and freedom of choice for European users and consumers.	77.20790627640552
We have voted against Amendments Nos 25 and 72 which would require the achievement of minimal anthroprogenic pollution in all groundwater.	42.29330468120812
It should seal their revival.	20.51880924505531
Parliament' s representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference must make it clear to those with whom they will be negotiating that, with the Union' s institutional changes, we are faced with responsibility for the constitutional development of the Union.	39.519971451986514
The intention of Florenz and Lange in their amendments is obvious: to sabotage the directive!	125.84888727029384
Mr President, this disaster at the mine in Romania affects a large hydrogeological area with rivers and watercourses in Romania, Hungary, Serbia and Bulgaria, The fact that 100 000 m3 of cyanide-poisoned water and large quantities of heavy metals have leaked out into the ecosystem is going to have appalling consequences for people in the area for a very long time to come, as well as for animal and plant life, agriculture, the tourist industry, biodiversity and the whole of the ecosystem.	65.83377855367569
We applaud the stabilisation and association agreements, but we would like to see more.	25.981594468252418
The legislative authority, Council and Parliament, should be equal.	127.05643665614878
Add to this the fact that he had to do this from his green approach and, against that background, find a compromise. That was not easy.	72.89531920004862
The most startling aspect of her original report was that she wanted to limit aid to the small group of refugees covered by the Geneva Convention, that is to say so-called quota refugees or UN refugees.	51.364958072709896
Yes, but the point is to make a qualitative leap and, speaking in political terms, this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, means convincing the other Community partners that to fall short would be the worst thing we could do at the moment.	80.97767000387029
A successive phasing out of State aid is required, and more and more markets must be opened up to competition.	41.41770272227268
Finally, it is to be hoped that greater coordination will be sought between the INTERREG initiative and the existing Community programmes, which are significant for external policy, as a vector for greater integration and for the joint drafting of programmes.	126.39625719133505
We are not making the connection so that the citizens can actually do something concretely either at home or in their offices or in industry to support action against global climate change.	89.45350051967597
I would therefore like, equally firmly, to express our rejection of the use of violence to resolve differences, which are still no doubt profound, between the parties.	44.47896348592391
We have expected the citizens to take on board the transition from EEC to EC to EU.	90.69234124472666
Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler.	4.132806748879505
In this resolution, Parliament is assuming its responsibilities.	44.64056338970977
Action must get under way immediately.	200.98422645473198
Addressing the fundamental question of relations with the United States, the Commission mentions just one priority: 'we will endeavour to reduce and eliminate as far as possible the disputes in transatlantic trade' (page 4).	54.392818277997385
The cofinancing provided by the Member State does not need to be additional to its existing expenditure.	49.563763035676764
I am convinced that you share my wish that it should be possible to adopt the regulation as soon as possible, especially in view of the fact that there are great expectations in the Member States and in other countries, especially among the applicant States which are now being given the opportunity to participate in LIFE.	37.883336673837256
The quality of services, which is so relevant to consumers, was a main concern of all speakers, some of whom, like Mr Rübig, were very explicit on this point.	94.54609674873842
Therefore, Commissioner, you can go ahead.	129.66107017742388
We, the Green Group, by and large support the common position.	53.161486520217515
Sound, factual information is in the best interests of the industry.	73.09172744881867
The new strategy outlined by the Commission communication on tourism and employment, and agreed by the Council, places the emphases on tourism gathering and disseminating information and good practice.	45.16038707253074
When I launched the White Paper last week I said that the shopping trolley is one of the most potent weapons on the face of the earth.	35.01074220064252
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 18 February 2000.	5.79316061411467
Madam President, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, at the time of our vote on your appointment we invited you to come here today.	20.59035392626955
We will take account of the economic and social constraints of the ACP countries in two ways: firstly, through human and social development policies to accompany economic and trade reforms and, secondly, by helping the ACP states to become active players in the international economic and trade system through capacity-building and cooperation in multilateral forums.	38.11520556406255
The ÖVP played no small part in helping Austria find its way into the European Union.	40.75823170681276
I can send the honourable Member, if he would like, a detailed breakdown of exactly where we stand on the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreements with each of the Central Asian republics.	75.48309005658182
First, the Committee on Development and Cooperation advocates the communitisation of the EDF; clearly that is misguided.	36.28622238555611
Examples have been given in Spain of Michelin and ABB-Alsthom and my colleagues will give examples for Italy.	81.74056537104788
I will therefore judge you on your deeds.	46.74583670390792
A free press and informed public opinion are the heart and soul of a democracy.	62.60571403645542
Like so many others, I too wonder where the people responsible are.	75.30558576071962
- (SV) The most important task of the approaching Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU before the accession of the new Member States.	8.932520395913562
However, the Council then took another direction at the very next summit in December and took a huge step backwards by deciding what we had absolutely rejected, i.e. that the Council should continue to be responsible for implementation, that the regulatory committee would be attached to the Council and that, where possible, Gibraltar would still be used to exert pressure.	58.901753363290815
The cost of a baby being born blind is too high; there are no benefits that can compensate for this.	42.20314942420737
But today, Egypt, Jordan and Palestine have peace treaties with Israel.	38.78400340735858
I have heard many comments on the Commission' s opinion, which mentioned all these subjects and dealt with many of them in depth, with specific indications of new draft articles, but no one has said that we were going beyond the Helsinki mandate.	51.80104434318415
It cannot create jobs by legislating to cut working hours, as if jobs were a cake that you carve up and divide between people.	82.70360127622747
I hope the number of Members in this Chamber is not an indication of the interest in overseas development work.	44.066085221782004
Madam President, today we have an appointment with hypocrisy.	37.65813247173693
Then we could have a solid dialogue in our everyday work.	89.55569879876602
If other sources of finance were to be investigated for each project, more resources would, moreover, be required than are available in the present situation.	59.96290306102774
More work on the social and economic impact of tourism is currently on-going with the international organisations, such as the World Tourism Organisation.	61.540249519623295
Certainly, it resembles Amendment No 1, but Amendment No 14 is better.	31.428471235492445
As Commissioner Wallström indicated during the hearings in the European Parliament in September 1999, the Commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and radiation protection in any relevant meeting with the Turkish Government in the future and I am happy to inform you that I will have a meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister in a couple of days and will certainly raise the issue.	46.59019793329382
The implementation of Agenda 2000 in the agricultural sector does not ultimately require more money.	54.99532509686423
I want to emphasise that, as early as 1997, the Commission proposed a special clause concerning manufacturer' s liability and that the Commission entirely supports the common position.	34.54094983260277
Firstly, let me make a statement of fact: the fruits of growth are not distributed equitably within the Union.	56.78078527067168
I feel there is a lot of scaremongering going on.	23.026794870407247
This would be a real tragedy and one which would weigh heavily on the conscience of us all.	31.72414142177957
What are we doing about it?	16.0845374300908
We welcome the report' s rejection of the idea originally put forward by the rapporteur of creating a taxation system, as this would be impossible to implement and enforce for all the Member States.	24.67740300952995
For if we must preserve the shoals of fish, we must also preserve the ports and the fishermen.	100.3433118426526
I am sure that the Commission can accept the report which, as you know, was approved unanimously in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.	14.652692493115186
Sometimes we may feel that too much has happened.	174.32550643773544
One of the people assassinated very recently in Sri Lanka was Mr Kumar Ponnambalam, who had visited the European Parliament just a few months ago.	51.32060167863894
I think we all acknowledge the economic, social and environmental importance of tourism in today' s developed Europe and its great potential for growth and employment.	22.140514028383958
Mr President, we have listened to the statements by the Council and the Commission and I would like to make the following observations.	13.062983007470239
Mr President, Commissioner, firstly, I too would like to congratulate Mr Corrie on the quality of his report, which appropriately reflects the tenor of the debates in the Joint Assembly he so effectively co-chaired.	13.0602254266722
Far too often, artificial fertiliser, veterinary medication and a host of other items are provided to farmers free of charge.	80.17908367689628
I must draw attention to the fact that the war in Angola is spreading to other parts of Africa.	59.48001610078296
Regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the Member States.	36.81647788297751
The European Commission and the Council must, at last, assume all the necessary responsibilities, both with regard to the adoption of a common position on the information and consultation of workers and with regard to Community and national aid, which must only be granted to companies who undertake to establish long-term agreements to protect jobs.	40.34164410465629
Mr President, Mrs Schroedter' s report undoubtedly contains several important observations, and I would like to congratulate her on that.	19.499393137271092
They are like a snake biting its own tail.	165.24087905377343
This ought to be done with, in particular, a view to combating poverty and through investing in the development of capacity.	71.6908500180159
They are a safe product, traded cross-border.	13.133513293963896
I urge the House to support these changes.	96.12653272410121
By renovating those structures and systems, in some cases very radically, we will assist the people of the Commission who are strongly committed to the European ideal and have high quality of capability to release talents and manifest themselves as never before.	62.99987670163214
I am confident that Commissioner Barnier and the President of the European Commission will duly consider Parliament' s position on the matter, in accordance with the Code of Conduct.	22.687322267961715
However, the incidents in El Ejido are a symptom of a phenomenon which is present throughout Europe and which deserves our full attention.	99.51873333592886
In so far as it is at all possible with all of the advice at our disposal and all of the design capability that we have, I am certain that we have installed, or that we will install on the basis of our proposals, a system that will provide the Union, its taxpayers and this House with complete security.	59.581105306805796
The Committee of Wise Men supports this.	15.795152885199082
Not because our delegation, our rapporteur and the chairman Mr Gargani did not work exceptionally well - they worked very hard indeed - and not because I have any strong objection to Commissioner Reding' s attitude - I think that, given the framework she was operating in, her attitude was particularly positive - but because of the negative and unacceptable position adopted by the Council.	72.6479660931318
The recognition that the 60 000 strong military force will be involved in both peacemaking and peacekeeping is also appropriate.	68.4740727748307
I hope that the Commission will not forget that.	19.685424904986405
So, we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it.	108.42744739951691
Following on from this, it is probably also more meaningful, with regard to the financial aid to regions, to give Member States more say anyway.	88.32262239705443
In other cases these operations were launched and implemented with less care and concern for those affected.	154.0432885396563
(Parliament adopted the resolution)	5.536307625563325
It is incomprehensible that an accident of this kind could have happened at all today.	46.533871276306094
I am also very sympathetic towards Amendment No 9, but I believe that it can be better formulated so as to join, at the same time, environmental concerns and disease control and eradication strategies.	25.165055356642487
That is why today we are asking not to have any nasty surprises in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism come Monday.	12.074643679398063
You may answer the question.	103.25553708179322
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, what has occurred in a tributary of the Danube is considered by many experts to be an accident on an environmental scale as serious as the scale of the Chernobyl disaster.	68.8796026411091
We also aim to include training in these issues in the basic training that our officials receive in project cycle management.	71.09122334711448
There have also been considerable anxieties expressed about the potential danger to the archaeological heritage in the area.	74.8578843462195
They were stripped naked and dragged along the floor by their hair, surrounded by a horde of state security police.	60.176813036395245
I hope that it works out.	46.20704820569765
If Mrs Schreyer is to visit the Black Forest sometime in the next few days, then any one farmer might ask her how the Commission and Europe would be able to help him as an individual.	83.54551434759595
It is happening with Buddhism in Tibet.	89.19087565229691
The medicine may not taste too good in the short term, but opening one' s economy to competition at home and abroad forces optimal application of resources and leads to a higher standard and quality of life in the not so longer term.	38.19242601835053
I should like you, Madam President, to express to the Council our wish that they be present at such votes in future.	124.99515351643586
We must make a rapid, strong and united response.	38.17792415910671
They will get their workforce to do more work at lower wages.	112.28355115537526
But it is not just a question of preventing or putting a stop to sickening instances of aggression perpetrated by individuals or institutions against those in a weaker position.	51.63192315519977
Mr Goebbels, I am sorry, but I think you are jumping the gun; Amendment No 37 is an oral amendment proposing that the words 'with a high rating base on a recognised rating scale' be moved. You were asking for the place to be changed.	49.84083044094955
The problem of water is becoming increasingly topical.	46.528158011220334
Of course, words can make a bit of a difference, a point that was made by Mrs Malmström.	97.24516927544764
Well now, Mr Andersson seems to think that the health situation will improve if we restrict the import of alcohol.	111.68007444852901
I cannot shake off the impression that, when it comes to human rights, despite all the rhetoric, Africa does not feature on top of the agenda of the Portuguese Presidency. This is something which I very much regret.	20.796837077017898
We have all seen some of the consequences on our television screens.	46.304147763909015
I think that the cause should first and foremost be sought in the lack of clear agricultural policy in the various developing countries, barring a few exceptions.	50.42309099099738
This distressing ambiguity on the part of the Kremlin is not really surprising.	29.630982372619826
For its part, the European Parliament, which had fought hard to ensure that the 1997 directive was balanced and respected the requirements of a universal public service, is rather satisfied to see that the compromise it obtained then is proving to be tenable.	45.97701532735307
I fully endorse the philosophy and the principles behind these decisions.	204.3945945632429
I would like to make it quite clear that the Liberal Group is against any political interference in companies, in terms of both finance and management.	34.64393892911682
The European Union has played a key role in developing the border county region in Ireland over the years.	39.14766686204297
There are enough other options in the present system to safeguard open markets and free competition.	53.128249417728775
Is it correct and proper that the department which owns the company is also the authority which issues the licence, and also the authority which basically takes the money from the EU and gives it to a company that it owns 100%?	107.15527059168167
That is why it is very important for the Intergovernmental Conference to take important decisions and to cut free so that the European Parliament' s efforts to create a meaningful cultural impetus within the European area may be rid of this constraint by all the governments.	25.151566915198117
This debate concerns a vital question which increasing numbers of people are legitimately raising. What are the respective places of people and finance in today' s economy?	52.845313944358864
I am committed to try to create a balance in all these issues and I would mention the achievement of the trade development and cooperation agreement with South Africa.	47.33323504349861
We have great confidence in the Portuguese Presidency' s ability to bring this task to a successful conclusion, and indeed great expectations thereof. Portugal is a small country, but being a small country is no reason why one may not have great ambitions.	61.72922180485361
The question of how best to make further progress has so far been solved through the idea of holding an inter-institutional congress which will open up an unbiased debate adopting a broad perspective and involving representatives of different interests.	53.95988931507615
With sorrow, I stress that in the context of restructuring the Commission' s services, tourism is dealt with by a section, not even a directorate, within the Directorate-General for 'Enterprise' .	67.51388487620676
What did I understand on reading the related texts?	111.90004423738873
I would merely ask when this is likely to take effect.	37.004456664265014
Naturally, the Commission is also glad that the European Parliament' s prompt decision - and I hope the vote will be in favour - means the framework decision can enter into force very rapidly now, so that we can begin to transpose it.	49.39061379801803
Tell me, what civilian forces are being mobilised, Mr Patten?	34.82760501009864
Experience in other areas has shown that preventative vaccination has the adverse affect of creating healthy virus carriers.	41.94757403010154
By the same token we have recently opposed arms sales to Indonesia, a stance that the Council unfortunately did not take into account.	31.18482025211427
Even America has now said that it is considering breaking off diplomatic relations.	51.99685726199673
What I asked and what I am once again asking is the following: what are the views of the Portuguese Presidency on, for example, the appeals made by the network to combat poverty and exclusion, the division of work and social security, the implementation of tax policies, particularly for speculative capital, and the policy of redistributing wealth?	86.44536148334764
I therefore welcome Amendments Nos 6, 10, 14, 24, 58, 60 and 88 .	4.764326935483703
I have given you my answer.	92.96504540280921
But I want to add a word of caution.	101.72699586702669
First of all, we would like to express sympathy with all the families and communities that lost members in this terrible tragedy.	38.20639765504623
We will then see, at ministerial level, how we can follow this up.	24.021616476388104
The lesson learned from the European experience is that where wages are lowest, where the salary ratio is the most flexible, unemployment is the highest and where wages are highest, where the social relations are the best regulated, the unemployment rate is the lowest.	57.12482666241304
It would have been much better if we had actually made the effort to reach compromises and to develop a common vision.	83.9726088954857
Fourthly, and finally, the prevention of inter-ethnic conflicts between States must be our constant concern and to some extent this can be achieved either through a strong and authoritative diplomatic offensive or with the proposals I have set out.	67.52040741744204
Alternatively, it could accept the offer of an agreement amongst the institutions, in order to move forward in another way.	81.46062060566399
These are fundamental issues which concern the very shape of the Statute for Members and of its role in the context of political society.	71.13396469758455
Which Community body will control the funding of the steering group and the monitoring committee and verify that the programme is carried out exactly and correctly?	73.86347686580623
An important part of the communication between the two institutions will obviously be to ensure that those of us who are involved in the drafting of legislation understand clearly and perfectly what it is the scientists mean, what problems they have identified, what legislation is necessary to deal with the issues they raise.	42.93308588678437
It has the advantage of clarity, and it can collect data and exchange experiences in order to agree on objectives and finely tune solid, comparative indicators and put forward recommendations.	149.05657936737904
Mr President, competition is at the heart of the European internal market policy and is also its driving force.	41.12949328098855
What I do not understand is why this has to come at a price, as it were, that is, of having to dispense with independent - and I stress, independent - prior approval.	71.51146977605119
We are all aware of the enormous expectations of our people with regard to freedom, security and justice, particularly social justice.	18.91204054508081
The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow.	3.2346666768331547
But the Prodi Commission now wants to transform the EU so that it can apply for joint global governance with the United States, which it also sees as its future competitor and rival.	59.004350326413615
Mr Wurtz, in no way can it be said that the Council is maintaining an ambiguous silence about this issue: the Council assumes total responsibility for its interpretation of the situation in Cyprus.	53.95454996208752
The preparation of this framework directive is therefore prompted by a desire for rationalisation.	74.58557298829054
This is not a straightforward issue and calls for a much more wide-ranging analysis, but I shall restrict myself to raising only a few points, in order to make people more aware, if possible, of what we are talking about.	36.204971310070306
This is the time when we should have expressed our opinion of the Commission proposal to put an end to the derogations.	41.54193143477347
This will involve, for example, disposing of more than 32 million lots of used oil, removing break fluid, etc.	25.203531320643478
However, it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such an Office.	122.85697272534844
I should say that the pieces of legislation that we have identified are intended to close gaps in existing legislation.	63.490293839940016
In my opinion, the Legal Affairs Committee and the rapporteur Mr Di Pietro have produced some very interesting work.	19.123881446697
As far as we are concerned, we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working classes.	21.486929535816152
I referred to the directive which the Commission has proposed on compulsory arrangements for means of public transport, so that people with special needs can use them.	30.367215405718245
Turning to the main themes of the resolution I offer the following observations.	74.30921371623698
I am aware of the Commission' s reluctance on this subject as it announced during the symposium on the presentation of INTERREG III last November.	27.778005404029475
In the tradition of our continent, this realisation is an important one which merits recognition.	62.790304213711046
This body was established back in March 1969 and is formally obliged to meet biannually, however the norm is that it meets annually and takes its decisions on the basis of scientific advice.	87.86783139977635
On the other hand, it manipulates the principle of positive discrimination. This is a politically correct fancy which can be just as harmful, as shown by the US precedent.	47.36791632265176
These events have caused us great pain and shame and have awoken our fears given the extreme racism, xenophobia and intolerance demonstrated.	35.94790956449434
In my opinion, there is too much initial hesitation.	29.767414612474045
They are most likely to occur if there is little democratic control on cash flow.	66.35697990571818
Please respect us as Members of Parliament who want to take our work seriously, and that includes the Tobin tax!	53.31246764307699
(In successive votes, Parliament adopted both legislative resolutions)	36.75914551254205
(Sustained applause)	17.34962308200157
I hope that in the fifth action programme, Minister and Commissioner, benchmarking will enable the best practices of those countries to be carried through, for it is time that our groups gained an understanding of this.	55.37316846910448
This, of course, does not mean that, if the economic climate is less than favourable, the budget could not fluctuate up or down slightly. It means that, in the long and medium term, there should be a balance or surplus.	62.77722517441653
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the motion for a resolution before us today is important because of its subject and the desire to protect the rule of law and press freedom. It is also very important because of the broad consensus which has finally been reached after some heated discussions behind the scenes.	32.87276141487421
I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council, after his few hours working in this Chamber with these Members of the European Parliament, whether he has come to any assessment of what they are worth in terms of pay?	37.07464382320687
I think it is a good thing that so many of us are expressing support for the approach he has adopted in it.	53.326945479877
We look to him as the man to root out cartels.	182.26616758343786
Nevertheless, it raises some very basic questions.	102.9353671786229
Mr President, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has proposed an essentially positive text, which I shall vote for, even if I personally had proposed a lot of amendments to broaden it.	50.30786681460633
It is of inestimable importance that people in Europe, as well as in the rest of the world, should have the opportunity to experience each other' s ways of ordering their lives and their societies.	54.66740046986038
Legal immigrants must be integrated socially without any excuses or delays.	42.864003516438196
Mrs Schroedter' s report marks a further step towards the transparency and effectiveness of structural aid.	89.25566995972606
At the moment, there are no concrete proposals which would allow us to make adjustments under this Article, and unless there is such a proposal, we cannot move forward on this matter.	49.9120663501829
We are very grateful for his leadership on this issue and for that of some of his colleagues, a number of whom are in the House this evening - Mrs Pack, Mr Lagendijk and others.	105.1677296964495
My reply is perhaps not satisfactory right now, but I would like to assure the honourable Member that the Commission will take that decision within a matter of weeks.	49.71685356604526
Since then, the Fisheries Council meeting of 16 December decided on drastic reductions in the total allowable catches for certain species such as cod and anchovy which were in the region of 25 percent for cod and 43 percent for anchovy for the year 2000.	55.53717892506598
The same line is being pursued with particular vigour in the Directorate-General for the Environment, where nearly 60 per cent of directors and 20 per cent of unit heads are women.	45.69276187492644
I would hope that the contribution of ALTENER would lead to more initiatives.	43.697125088306954
In 1998 and 1999 Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan received technical assistance of EUR 75 million.	32.870173089517834
Deploying the German multipurpose ship "Neuwerk" - it is right outside my front door in Cuxhaven - entailed the swift provision of European neighbourly help.	34.77938732195481
It would be politically astute not to isolate the ÖVP but to support it as an undeniably democratic, constitutional and well-known European party, so as to be equally certain that Austria will continue to be a Member of this European Community, and that is why we must give the ÖVP our support in this difficult situation, and isolation would be altogether the wrong line to take!	56.92256654093295
I have one last point to make, which is about the European Union' s responsibility and, specifically, in this case, about possible action by the Council in this matter, and the responsibility of the international community, which has overall responsibility for the situation in Kosovo.	42.15316718084561
Secondly, there is currently a democratically elected government in Chile, led by Ricardo Núñez, whose first declaration was that all those who have committed this type of crime must face justice, and I would remind you that the Chilean justice system, which is independent, is currently examining 60 complaints lodged against General Pinochet, concerning his crimes against humanity.	53.50273941886455
So I thoroughly recommend and hope that the Parliament will support this excellent report.	46.31717174021125
Secondly, it will be important to approach development policies from a different angle in this context, taking advantage of their capacity for correcting imbalances and reducing inequality.	65.74722787250526
How can the Commission ensure that this sort of development financed through the Structural Funds does not conflict with the nature conservation needs of the area?	41.93552651792642
As to the proposal to establish a maximum custodial sentence of not less than eight years, I do not think that this will raise any problems as far as my country is concerned, even though the maximum sentence for counterfeiting under its criminal code is currently five years in prison, as it has already expressed willingness to make this amendment.	72.7210898404896
I welcome the renewed warmth in relations between the Greek Government and the Turkish Government.	35.68303891437278
Secondly, we wish to see an exact progress report on the invitations to tender and the schedule for their implementation.	39.03718306256652
There is the tragic monument of the Holocaust, the death of 6 million Jews, to those who argued the same case with respect to Germany in the 1930s.	70.0639173949906
Mr President, this Parliament is fragmented and divided.	89.46042433013902
Amendments Nos 49, 50 and 51, which share the same basis, are not acceptable because they make substantial changes to the consistent approach of the Commission regarding the regulations of third party delegation, and do not offer sufficient security to the competent authorities and investors.	96.21151967867982
Finally, we need to set up a system which prepares an objective list of potentially dangerous substances, using the increased information available on their chemical, physical and biological properties, in such a way as to create an integrated model for intervention at a range of strategic levels in order to protect our water heritage, which is fundamental to us all.	51.61014026591621
There is little point in having streets which are now wonderfully lit, with new pavements, with newly paved road surfaces, all whitewashed and beautiful, if we are not able to fill them with activity and, therefore, employment.	29.926629401484274
As there is no vaccination, farmers can only protect themselves by not buying animals from countries in which there are cases of scrapie.	36.14460019588751
We have been discussing the Tobin tax proposal for twenty years and yet the question is still topical because we need really concrete and honest answers based on careful studies.	50.725190353493346
Perhaps there was a certain amount of residual misunderstanding on the part of the Commission.	46.409430321256764
I know what I am talking about and I will conclude by telling you why I am so glad we are holding this debate!	36.901216597914555
Yesterday it was impossible for myself and many MEPs to be here, because the 2.15 p.m. Air France flight, which normally brings us here, was cancelled, with no explanation from the airline, and we therefore arrived very late.	82.36767242343119
I agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the Commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the Member States on simplifying administration, and I support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labour-intensive, small and medium-sized enterprises, on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing, and on start-up help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields.	57.20269185812908
Only in this way can we create a new culture in the Commission and at the same time get public confidence restored.	34.26920674749925
In the system we propose reforming our substantive rules in such a way that most SMEs will be covered by block exemption regulations, as in the field of vertical restraints.	38.36011417017558
In expressing the hope that these men will be the last victims of ETA, I call on this organisation finally to cease resorting to violence and to use the democratic channels that exist in Spain.	91.03570783391557
Finally, the positive effects on national administrations of the system of management of the Structural Funds, the motives of officials in managing these funds, even if it is occasionally complicated, and the importance of once again making improvements to the procedures for the evaluation, follow-up and supervision of the Commission.	76.083733784599
In Germany, there would probably be dancing in the streets if we were to say that we were holding a referendum on payments to the European Union and we shall pay if the German people are prepared to pay.	64.5987320716795
We need stronger banking supervision.	13.333251412750466
We must leave raw materials so that local manufacturers can process them.	42.00901958676705
However, I would ask these colleagues to show solidarity with the more than 2 million people who make a living from building cars in Europe, so that these jobs can be secured in the future.	35.9257903569167
I very much fear that we are to have yet another authority that flies through Europe anonymously like a satellite; an authority of this kind would be anathema to me and I hope it does not come to that.	30.320261088503237
As a new Member of the European Parliament, it has been very interesting and instructive for me to be given responsibility for this important matter.	37.03498584477727
For us in the north it will mean that the EU will be destroying the social infrastructure.	37.236093408359686
We must establish priorities and make sure there is value for money in each of these programmes.	42.40166541934492
At times like this we are all aware of how much more we need to do to prevent disasters and to deal expeditiously with the disasters that we are not able to prevent.	72.07452746764577
The governments which, through spinelessness or ideology, support you are also responsible.	138.8391499883931
My investigations also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case.	36.87468914647464
We are always saying think globally, act locally.	11.091920734065292
According to the Rules of Procedure, you are not required to reply.	36.30032174845484
I therefore propose, in agreement with the rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, that the words 'issued by' be replaced with 'dealt with' throughout Amendment No 37.	34.54492929720326
It is only by complying with the essential agreements established with the programmes following on from the stability pact and by developing a market with less obstacles at all levels that we will reach the levels of competitiveness required by the European Union.	46.16301770327837
However, that should not prevent us from harmonising the text in order to ensure that there is no legal uncertainty between the various directives.	60.30250781177578
Because the joint motion for a resolution proposes a range of effective mechanisms for ensuring coherence, I shall use the very short time allotted to me here just to mention one more such mechanism, namely obliging the Commission to carry out an evaluation of new, relevant legislation from this aspect.	73.13880778425388
But, as I have already mentioned, our overriding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness.	37.8076058853738
What can the European Union do in these circumstances?	28.4654100984195
It creates and maintains interpersonal relationships.	58.1602337824268
The low level of releases of Palestinian prisoners and the fact that the Israeli Government appears to intend halting implementation of building permits already granted, as well as not approving new ones, pose further obstacles.	39.268555627864586
Coordination of Community tourism activities with other important issues such as regional policies, transport, employment, environment, culture and competition must strongly involve Member States and the tourism industry itself.	90.80549901892878
The Commission has not only to listen to Parliament and take into account parliamentary proposals but, as is well-known, must also deal with the Council.	44.51178491173424
The Rules of Procedure do not allow this.	15.741929287110468
Before military intervention by NATO, Milosevic' s policy for Kosovo was certainly to be condemned, and the demands of the non-violent forces of the Rugovo era for the Kosovar regions to be autonomous were justified.	100.83050925826699
In this respect, and because Turkey is situated on the periphery of the European Union, we should be helping it to become a more secure, peaceful and cooperative country.	56.49883214183595
A5-0007/2000 by Mrs Berger, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on a proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the posting of workers who are third-country nationals for the provision of cross-border services (COM(1999)3 - C4-0095/1999 - 1999/0012(COD));	2.762038022178619
In its opinion on the holding of an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Treaties, the Commission noted that the European Council must decide during the year 2000 on the inclusion of certain items on the IGC agenda, in particular the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.	32.40830378439719
Commissioner, if the European institutions really believe in what they say about full employment, they must take clear steps to secure this.	100.80967027469343
Furthermore, the centralised European system, as we can see it developing today and as we can foresee it by extrapolation, erodes nations and, in eroding nations, erodes the national patriotism which forms the basis of our will to defend ourselves.	103.1826041989312
Finally, it is essential that we slow down the logging of standing wood, in order to give priority to the purchase of windfalls.	33.33425596807319
It will also continue to fight for Member States' acceptance of this.	29.947181753464175
Mr President, I think we all agree that a European legal area must be created.	33.271488464029474
The protective measures cover these countries too, and the views expressed by these countries have carried a lot of weight.	136.0771502125229
She has clearly identified the problems created by the approval of the World Intellectual Property Organisation' s treaties.	36.03058916363076
You said that in Lisbon you intend to discuss more dynamic and competitive development.	42.413885636392365
Madam President, the timetable must ensure that, by December of this year during the French presidency, the process can be completed with a major conference of forces from all the countries to ensure that the needs and capacities match. We will then be able to say truthfully that we have a plan of what we must do between the end of the year 2000 and the year 2003 which is the date we have set for having this capacity available.	72.94826081151444
It is high time there was peace in the Middle East.	15.454904827555493
We fully support the innovative approach towards setting up development partnerships and organising the exchange of experience at European level as an integral part of the EQUAL programme.	34.415721498091
As the House knows and has repeatedly said, the scale and scope of the Union's financial interventions have grown immensely in the past decade without a proportionate increase in staffing or an adjustment in procedures.	36.746192369100044
You should know that the country which cooperates most with FYROM and has the best relations with it, in the entire area, is Greece, and this has contributed greatly to the stability of the area.	61.53398337875782
Mr President of the Commission, you have represented and defended the European Parliament time and again over recent weeks.	39.13689842750612
This is the crux of the matter.	5.766631480061359
My specific question concerns the problem of homelessness and whether a new presidency could take a new initiative to try to overcome some of the difficulties the President-in-Office alluded to with regard to support at intergovernmental level.	76.06221988594872
At the same time, it must be made clear that aid can serve a useful purpose, with a view to offsetting the deficiencies of the market and furthering Community objectives.	32.682070754583435
Some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course.	145.32319554675982
And so I would like to repeat my question as to whether the Council intends to take more specific action to debate these issues with Mr Kouchner, who has a major responsibility for the situation in Kosovo today.	55.564009998016736
We shall therefore get straight back to work on this White Paper, although in order to finish it, we shall have to wait for the results of the Intergovernmental Conference, and it will therefore not be ready until spring 2001.	34.24960598174167
This is naturally on the condition that the delay does not exceed three weeks, as Prime Minister Barak has promised.	80.18239313634169
The Commission feels, for this reason too, that it should not present a modified proposal for amendments to the regulation, but I would nevertheless like to convey to you the Commission' s opinions on the amendments under discussion.	51.64422305775498
Africa has the largest number of refugees in the world, the most overall poverty and a debilitating AIDS epidemic.	91.93915817857068
In principle, I believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country-specific rules.	56.20502038891029
B5-0175/2000 by Mr Bautista Ojeda and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on xenophobia-related incidents in El Ejido (Spain).	13.723991153839378
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	2.445252009376798
Madam President, Commissioner, a compromise resolution on the usefulness of a tax on international financial flows would constitute a first step towards the essential amendment of many international rules.	96.09851974879129
Most committee members have sought rather to find a balance between, on the one hand, the need to see that both states and businesses comply with the competition rules and, on the other hand, acknowledgement of the value of such aid with a view to contributing to the objectives of the Treaty, particularly, as I have said already, as regards sustainable development, research and development and economic and social cohesion.	26.784057138812795
The next item is the oral question (B5-0011/2000) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, to the Commission, on the shipwreck of the Erika.	8.000645983790417
Mr President, we are indeed now in a very rare situation: those who wish to uphold environmental values will take the side of the Council in their common position.	49.14983176018002
Otherwise, there is a danger of people taking the law into their own hands. It is therefore also important that local officers should be trained, and the idea was, in fact, that 2 000 to 3 000 officers should be trained.	48.99511003165028
In the current negotiations on this third Community support framework, I have asked for the provisions on the partnership principle to be fully respected, with regard to both regional and local authorities and to non-governmental organisations and associations.	50.42655811524267
Thank you very much, Commissioner Nielson.	10.827848152413875
Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I hear that you have a strong voice. I hope it is loud enough to be heard in Madrid for I realise that what you have said was not strictly intended for me.	74.83233592748591
I am delighted to be able to be able to set out the Commission's position on the report.	13.966913850728032
First of all, could I express my thanks on behalf of President Prodi and my colleagues in the Commission for the support and understanding offered by several Members of the House to the position taken by the Commission in the statement that we made yesterday.	27.800555753749467
I want to start by saying that I am pleased to be presenting this communication on the use of the precautionary principle, and it has been written together with David Byrne and Erkki Liikanen.	17.053199830751808
Some of them also sail under the Maltese flag.	45.88022114487733
The plastics industry for the most part does not want to take these things back and cannot economically do so.	51.72659392057219
The Committee of Independent Experts said the Commission was not managing this properly.	25.380590811412443
According to these conclusions, the Charter must contain three categories of rights. The first category is rights of freedom and equality and procedural rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.	44.88727543228594
The virus is known not to survive above 25o Celsius and scientists have therefore agreed that no threat to human health exists; it simply cannot survive in warm-blooded creatures.	95.26413742187867
Madam President, under Rule 29(4) you should be kept informed by political groups of any Members who have joined a new political group or who have left a political group.	145.6994582790325
Does the President of the Council not think that we should stop talking and implement tough measures in this area, bearing in mind that we now have the means to control this type of oil tanker on the high seas?	38.318096789246056
I would like to widen the debate and include the situation in Mitrovica.	59.11306844411221
And what about vehicles which are already on the road?	17.67243336665357
Vaclav Havel stated that, in Eastern Europe, the Communist regimes methodically destroyed civil society: national movements, churches and the independent trade unions.	41.649689519032314
Mr President, a year has not yet passed, but it is already clear that Parliament is going to evaluate the first and second reports differently.	38.727662680411704
This also means that, in any case, I have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she sent on 10 January but also for the action points which she announced today.	38.35956801877105
The major part of it has to do with well known established differences of interest between sexes and so on, and this is the problem.	36.834266520021245
What is all-important, to my mind, is that the bodies we are financing should achieve what we want them to achieve, a multi-ethnic Kosovo that is, a Kosovo where people can live together.	117.77241615337941
INTERREG must, therefore, be an instrument promoting territorial cohesion throughout the Union if we do not wish to see a two- or even three-speed European territory.	34.155989639760534
But if the Commissioner wishes to offer doctrine or good intentions ...	33.33372757692732
The only proposal which has been made is for the directive on family reunification. This is a key issue, as we have seen recently in the media that there are many men on their own in El Ejido.	43.479659002411346
We have now tabled a proposed amendment on precisely this compromise with the Commission on the text.	60.203931695563476
It is likely that postal liberalisation will lead to greater cost differences between countries, which will no doubt have implications for competition, which will not only affect the cost of the postal service but also the establishment of installations.	69.59731234401688
What is happening in France, Mr President, appears prima facie to be a case of discrimination against other EU nationals on grounds of nationality and as such to be in breach of the Treaties.	60.232125350647266
Thank you, Mrs Banotti.	13.790920973039846
Madam President, it is in itself an achievement that we are having this debate on the new URBAN Community initiative and it is an achievement that I am here tonight because Air France cancelled my flight at 2.10 p.m. but I am here!	26.62365995480947
It is nothing more than the States playing at taking from Peter in order to give to Paul.	24.65476802608597
Therefore, I would urge the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area.	43.40223541884
Nevertheless, I would point out to the Commission that, as far as the Socialist Group is concerned, there has been a change of priorities.	41.59824317420051
One might ask how it is that the current Commission is to receive the discharge for its predecessor' s budgetary management - Mr Camre just mentioned this - particularly as the discharge for the previous year, 1996, was denied.	90.65030871429903
We cannot allow our European water to be polluted, Mr President, and we must produce a directive which will strengthen the political will of governments to preserve the resource of water, which is so precious to all of us.	81.71330012216536
And so long as people do not have equality before the law, this inequality will lead to discrimination and human rights will be eroded.	55.877002260864515
We therefore have a number of amendments.	28.913520045868587
We Swedish Christian Democrats also oppose any threats which have been made to delay the enlargement of the EU to the east if the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference is not extended very considerably to include subjects in addition to those left over from the Intergovernmental Conference in Amsterdam in 1997.	40.74433986336493
Clearly, many citizens are 'disenchanted and anxious' about the lack of real and lasting solutions to basic problems, such as unemployment and social exclusion, which affect our very existence. This must be one of our absolute priorities.	69.74703420158373
The EU should apparently adopt what are called real convergence criteria, which would be binding and of real effect.	81.60450952676317
How will we judge, ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, the five years of our mandate?	56.05023903273
This House has already indicated its opposition to driftnets and yet it is evident that certain countries are not only not respecting the undertaking to eliminate these nets but are increasing the number of vessels using these or simply not providing data given the passiveness of the national and Community authorities.	68.86102120955553
Enlargement - that is enlargement of the Union - is one of the key challenges in this context.	31.56236221965258
However, the Committee on the Environment has tabled numerous amendments, most of which I support.	35.168884335398694
Mr President, I should like make a comment in connection with a meeting held last night by various Members of Parliament from all groups.	76.81873861861388
Public monopolies must be replaced by competitive structures.	47.842558385389935
However, we cannot used simulators in cases relating to nuclear energy.	25.598125479753353
The agenda must go much further. We must be much more daring with regard to the issues dealt with in the IGC and we must be much more transparent and much more democratic.	52.14333925028433
It is clear from statements over the past years that Jörg Haider and the Freedom Party do not respect human rights and fundamental freedoms with respect to third country nationals and minority groups living in Austria.	30.00357255155605
This can only be detected if controls undertaken are more rigorous.	21.264535115513542
She will be able to fill a filing cabinet with letters about what is claimed to be the real situation in China.	45.44296504886284
This is an urgent duty for the EU.	17.861709039675507
Madam President, I should like to add my congratulations to Commissioner Prodi's programme.	27.53852094004177
Mr Rapkay' s report also emphasises the importance of the international dimension with regard to competition law.	32.037439270340755
The lawyer-linguists should work very carefully to ensure that a reasonable version is produced.	161.94259847343437
If the French Government insists that we continue to meet in Strasbourg, it could at least ensure, where flights are diverted to Basle, that buses arrive on time to meet the diverted passengers, otherwise it is quite pointless for us to try to arrive here on Monday and attend to any kind of business.	51.03975384993309
How can we describe the rapes, the looting, the deliberate fires, the deportations, which are called "cleansing" , that recall the worst episodes of the Middle Ages in Europe?	33.815274132608465
This is why I give this report my full support.	36.706367055029354
They are growing, but only in terms of GDP.	61.36032039205846
We are therefore unable to approve the development of strand IIIC of the Community initiative encouraging interregional cooperation under the responsibility of the Commission and sidelining the Member States.	41.154860501048226
In this context, Parliament has already played a key role in the discussions on the draft directive on copyright in the Information Society, which led to the approval of the Barzanti report in February 1999.	40.813708014390095
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my answer by reminding you of the position adopted by the Commission with regard to the formation of the new Austrian Government. This was reiterated this morning in President Romano Prodi' s speech on that government which includes Ministers from Jörg Haider' s Freedom Party.	21.335996167233294
In all other areas, I believe that subsidiarity is also relevant to this discussion.	67.3741404568124
In this respect, the Commission' s proposals to amend directive 91/68 and delete the reference to scrapie and the report by Mrs Roth-Behrendt on the detection and control of TSE infections in general, comply with Parliament' s demands in the wake of the follow-up report by the BSE committee of inquiry and we expressly welcome this.	52.789412830316614
So, in the coming months, we will be producing communications from the Commission, for example, which have a direct bearing on the whole question of preventing conflict or managing crises.	35.073967486322346
But what were the Commission' s arguments, from Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies and Director-General Eneko Landaburu in particular, for eliminating the URBAN programme?	83.45422588700549
All of these measures are designed to make it more coherent, understandable and flexible.	106.50101069237266
We have resubmitted a few amendments which fell in committee, in particular, our desire to see the codes of conduct revised specifically to include the reference to merit and managerial capacity which you, Commissioner, accepted - when we had our hearings last September - should be included in these codes of conduct, particularly when considering appointments and promotion.	47.76668298230892
The desire expressed in Amendments Nos 60 and 93 for a list of goals and a list of substances for which no adequate data is available cannot be approved.	81.80101864284157
Many volunteers from France and other European countries have expressed their solidarity by lending a hand to the victims in the field.	72.60952518582546
But this directive has never been transposed into national law.	45.94088914006226
What decision will the Council adopt to put an end, once and for all, to this ethnic cleansing and to guarantee respect for the human rights of the whole population of Kosovo, irrespective of race or creed?	41.18939746850355
I am also thinking of the importance of strengthening the applicant States' links with trans-European networks in the shape of both physical forms of transport and IT infrastructure.	56.50917487177019
With liberalisation, how will it be possible for the universal postal service to be funded and to operate correctly in a country such as my own, Greece, with its particular geographical features and its numerous, small but inhabited islands?	52.816838908406815
The agenda is designed to transfer vital parts of society' s criminal law, policy on crime and administration of justice to the EU' s control.	64.4070482778228
Let our citizens know that our common policies in justice and home affairs are about freedom, not just about repression.	55.65295474214646
The Commission is already considering the implications for the European Union of the recent encouraging developments.	42.003972602186806
A working party has been set up with the express task of revising the Commission' s mechanisms. This working party has worked hard to reach agreement that it is essential to enhance the effectiveness of the present mechanisms and to make them more rigorous, especially in the financial field.	65.03744486006943
I should also draw your attention to the significance of the Barcelona process which should have a beneficial impact on regional cooperation.	40.76087605418748
The one and only significance of the European Union is the will to transcend the atrocious history of the twentieth century which gave the coup de grâce to any ideal of humanism within the heart of Europe, and which is still highly topical today.	60.35051753812393
Globalisation, free trade, and the hegemony of the WTO with its internationalist philosophy, were imperilling the very essence of the North-South dialogue.	66.1846419958361
The Danish authorities do not consider that they are obliged under Community law to pay this compensation to workers taking early retirement who do not meet the conditions required under Danish law.	59.09912932596407
They all made a vital constructive and balanced contribution.	212.61580699879215
I hope that in his pursuit of dialogue around the regions of Europe, Commissioner Barnier will expand upon that thought and learn from what he hears.	47.931392936734696
Whether or not the agenda will ultimately be widened is still the subject of debate and on this point I would like to extol the political conduct of the Portuguese Presidency, which has repeatedly made a commitment to the European Parliament to make the necessary efforts towards that end.	53.553399316623164
They should be able to do so without compromising their equal opportunities and equal treatment.	40.597104484480724
Compare it with what happens in December.	25.24425980720241
It means that in Fleetwood, 30 inshore boats are tied up until the end of April.	45.90781858093386
Mr President, first I want to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Frassoni, for her work.	12.84837951901814
We must take up a reasoned offensive against radicals on both the right and the left.	49.65352719315257
Journalists, on the other hand, who are simply going about their work in Russia, i.e. endeavouring to produce reports which are as objective as possible, are being treated like criminals.	64.51314246189668
These very innovative approaches provide a good opportunity to improve governance.	38.45964753820786
In brief, I would like to say that we are entering the period when we are called upon to manage the programming for 2000-2006, which must be no routine period for the good reason that we have two major challenges to face.	46.561035910032494
Sometimes the more we speak, the less we hear - motions: words; conventions: words; treaties: words - if we are not careful, words themselves become a substitute for real action.	41.76014252516091
Having said this, we must accept that elections are always taking place in the countries of the European Union.	36.68682655963796
They should therefore be protected by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting once they have been withdrawn from circulation.	19.592162517058885
I am thinking, for example, of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations.	62.63810268410947
We must therefore take these memorandums into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work.	49.33786769318121
Concerning Mr Evans' point regarding the implications for businesses, it is important that the cost-benefit analysis should be seriously conducted.	52.38902713463445
But I warn against using these programmes to take urban culture to the countryside.	81.1513494808399
If we do things properly, this may well be a first taster of a genuine common foreign and security policy.	22.535055465086717
We are therefore quite prepared to support the liberals' amendment to keep aid independent from the donor states' interests, for we need to give industry in Macedonia and the region the best possible opportunities with the aid money available for reconstruction.	72.99914368826451
Furthermore, I would ask the Commission to please reconsider the limited opportunities that have been offered to the most remote and island regions according to the guidelines put forward in the communication.	24.982692138435322
From an Irish perspective, I know that the Irish Department of the Environment is already having consultations with motor industry representatives to ensure that appropriate collection centres are put in place in Ireland in the near future to deal with end-of-life vehicles.	43.9291070450216
That is why we can only hope - and we should resolve all of this this week - that, in 2001, we will finally have Community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our roads are a good deal safer.	42.60326419009785
50 is exactly the level of development of my own region, the Azores, one of the regions defined in the Treaties as ultra-peripheral.	59.1966573584446
Amendments Nos 29, 31 and 41 water down the requirements concerning the dismantling of vehicles.	73.802801995748
You will remember that we decided with great expectations here in the European Parliament in December that Eurodac would become a reality as a regulation and as a system, as a Community instrument which we urgently need in order to prevent multiple asylum applications, in order to have an instrument to fight illegality and, above all, in order to set out clearly which Member State was responsible for implementing the asylum procedure.	64.46395031059083
Out of 410 applications in 1999 only 55 projects with a low overall volume of EUR 6.07 million could be considered.	85.363742307866
This loss is unjustified in a region whose main activities have been ruined by free-trade Europe.	41.79353769586088
We have done a lot in the Balkans: the new European Reconstruction Agency for Kosovo, the Balkans Task Force and new regulations to speed up procedures.	84.58005864021656
I hope that in accepting our proposal the European Parliament acknowledges our commitment and I would be very grateful for that.	56.78055674630434
Faced with these social challenges, the effectiveness of the Structural Funds is still in doubt.	77.82839496906678
We explicitly address corruption; we establish a framework for dealing with the problem of immigration for the first time ever.	65.68175951709699
For example, Acting President Vladimir Putin gave an assurance last Monday that he had ordered the country' s security services to bring the missing reporter back to Moscow safely.	87.54085052536331
Due to its importance on a world scale, the euro will be particularly exposed to the risk of counterfeiting and forgery.	71.26872777311588
I think that it is also obvious that our ability to act is linked to the Commission' s own scope for intervening, through its right of initiative.	22.091462953196366
As important is the fact that Austria' s forces of democracy should be given support, as none of us wishes to isolate the country.	58.06259475514201
First, financial management and control within the Commission must be improved.	28.679865487660056
I believe that access to clean drinking water without charge is a basic human right in the developed as well as the developing world.	32.42539350069456
There is effective legal precaution.	67.67109963070035
Report (A5-0018/2000) by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference (14094/1999 - C5-0341/1999 - 1999/0825(CNS))	3.2586804200748962
To respect my speaking time, I will confine myself to referring only to the broad outlines of my programme: a programme for the dawning of a new legislature and a new century, when it is right and proper to see Europe in a broader perspective, a Europe which is currently in a paradoxical situation.	66.38572559992159
The changes in financial management and control will greatly enhance the possibility of doing all of that.	113.71003226998714
What is more, the work carried out in Brussels should be of a much higher quality and be completely transparent, so that people might at least have some small sense of owning the process, now that Mr Prodi and his predecessor have taken their autonomy away from them.	59.47255638040917
The vote will be taken later this evening.	12.081038727527215
It must become more flexible and more responsible to labour market conditions.	103.07624227144142
An environmental policy agreement has been signed on a voluntary basis.	37.75388364957893
The question before us now is what can the Commission do to provide more practical support for his Holiness, the Dalai Lama' s, proposal for a peaceful solution to the Tibet affair?	62.57075792847738
In fact, this directive, like so many others addressing environmental issues, is not good.	32.98135705414857
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I must indicate my complete and categorical condemnation of the terrorist attack on 22 February in Vitoria which took the lives of the socialist MP and spokesman in the Basque parliament, Fernando Buesa, and his bodyguard, Jorge Díez.	12.660254246525966
I would like to say that in the meantime there will be at least four European Councils, those in Lisbon and Feira and two during the French presidency.	26.414843728196594
Without protection under intellectual property law, creativity is inhibited and financial incentives obstructed.	35.316535549141435
I would have liked to hear your discussion with the Austrian President, Mr Poettering. We are well aware that he is very embarrassed today at the dirty deal that government has done in forming such an alliance.	50.15231866110417
On the other hand, Parliament is issuing a resolution in one vote, for which we can see the agreement amongst the various speakers who have preceded me. I think that this is an opportunity to put parliamentary pressure on the doubts or evasions of a few governments and I think that we are providing the Commission with a powerful political act for the preparation of a European maritime area.	29.552307654864826
So, yes to liberalisation, but let us also think about the limits to liberalisation, rapidly create reasonable conditions in Europe and submit the appropriate study to the Commission.	103.21426463922352
Above all, it lacks drive in the sectors I have mentioned, for example, as regards the Balkans.	120.26728861390306
Nevertheless, we now have more precise information: we know that the acting Russian President himself, Mr Vladimir Putin, asked Russian special services to safeguard Andrey Babitsky' s life and freedom.	77.48455673258024
Mr President, I voted for the resolution and should like to explain my motives.	17.842503060944303
We need a policy mix which includes long-term political commitments, as in Sweden and Finland; they now have governments in which women account for 56% and 44% of members respectively.	80.38370913579803
It must therefore be able to count on the support of the Members of the European Parliament, who will surely rally behind this proposal.	25.3311882087602
At present, we trust that the Commission will produce these sound proposals, but it is not a foregone conclusion that it will do so.	49.6576218218126
I would like to remind the House that at second reading Parliament adopted this report containing eight amendments, including a re-instatement of the Commission' s original budget.	21.31617610758577
Can I assure her that our attitude is not guided by any motivation to farm out.	120.96753321191066
What happened at El Ejido is the result of inadmissible racist and xenophobic practices in Europe today.	31.457627255354545
From the point of view of the Commission, in this interinstitutional game, I believe that this is important and I am very happy to highlight it.	23.02424787190355
Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, I want to express our most profound feeling of solidarity with the families of Fernando Buesa, an elected representative of the Basque people, and Jorge Díez, a member of the Basque police force. We also naturally want to express our solidarity with the whole of the Basque Socialist Party.	15.473317551576056
The big question, however, is from what budget heading should this aid be financed?	230.78078328359788
Agriculture is one of the cornerstones of the rural environment and it must be possible for it to have a part in the LEADER initiative.	72.39267377675843
All the more reason for Members of the European Parliament, Ministers, Commissioners to devote a little time to explaining matters to the citizens, to public debate.	86.15075975469259
The Kosovo problem is well-known and the international community is present there on a massive scale.	87.2111657119355
Mr President, in my previous life I ran two manufacturing businesses, one in the United Kingdom and one in the Netherlands.	31.055328897060583
Is a monopoly flexible enough in a market where the customer' s requirements and the market situation can change very rapidly, because, for example, the use of electronic data carriers has increased dramatically?	117.79658255714129
We would also underline the importance of the way in which the strategy is handled. On the one hand, it would be useful to have guidelines and a process styled on Luxembourg, but we also think it is important, as is already mentioned by Mrs Van Lancker, that guidelines are drafted to accommodate less typical work scenarios, such as sole traders, etc.	26.15145958533602
All this, of course, does not mean that our Group does not share the concern of the Italian Members regarding the effects of the closure on the region concerned.	37.326087816555564
The Union for a Europe of Nations Group, on the other hand, wishes to see a polycentric Europe with nations linked in a network.	25.517055859563225
Then, sanctions must be harmonised between the 15 Member States; they should not be different, but the same throughout the Union.	45.59921264492945
In the United States the WIPO Treaty has already entered into force, having been enacted into law by means of the Digital Millennium Corporate Act and there they have managed to retain the delicate balance of the Treaty by means of this legislation.	52.46397914836639
Mr President, the Director-General of the DG for Development has said that to produce a report on coherence of EU policies with development policies, before this spring' s paper on development policy itself, is like putting the cart before the horse.	59.99626140146397
Under this umbrella, each Member State is to submit proposals in the form of a Community initiative programme for that particular country.	106.57770475314764
I would like to make one general point on politics. Whatever we may say about the European elections, the low turnout is a fact.	71.84717912648033
Mr President, "The EU' s development cooperation leaves a great deal to be desired" .	9.403754115497534
One reason they have not been dealt with is that as ever the leopard cannot change its spots, i.e. in the case of this framework decision, which specifically relates to judicial cooperation, the Council once again prefers to adhere to the level of government cooperation.	54.35168844163975
It was a remarkable speech and I hope that Mr Gollnisch, who is no longer able to be with us, was able to hear that speech as well.	52.506300913682345
(Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)	4.44944329902736
There is no doubt whatsoever that this revision process will be the most important thing to affect the fishing industry for many years.	65.45282726182138
The solution is to take out a derivative which pays off if the NASDAQ or CAC 40 falls.	45.87093611106466
We must govern Europe in such a way as to make us more efficient, to bring us closer to the citizens and to encourage everyone to get involved, starting with the important issue of the involvement of women.	35.90578942787882
In the future, funding will no longer come from three funds but from the EAGGF Guidance section alone.	76.18779981318781
The first proposal extends the number of instruments in which an 'undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities' (UCITS) can invest.	41.877625518656835
Thank you, Mr van Velzen.	27.834055680774668
The use of selective fishing gear which reduces incidental unwanted catches and limits the throwing of unwanted fish back into the sea is certainly essential, as is a reduction of the pressure from the fishing industry offshore, as well as in coastal waters.	45.341359142229805
Mr President, this morning' s debate is very important.	18.97564045406315
You might have run out of political arguments but that does not give you the right to use those who were murdered as cheap propaganda.	50.69982181159994
As you know, the European Community has contributed a total of EUR 378 million for the province of Kosovo alone, and this has to be seen in conjunction with the contributions made by Member States at national level.	33.132511439471735
The Lomé Convention essentially benefits a few large industrial or financial conglomerates, which continue to pillage those countries and perpetuate their economic dependence, notably on the former colonial powers.	28.46501001722907
We do not consider that Amendments Nos 2 and 14 add anything to the directive.	23.10296851948837
It is good that URBAN is to continue, as it has had good results at local level.	75.78717330131157
A characteristic example is Greece, which as an Objective 1 country was included as a whole in the LEADER Community initiatives, and where the average annual reduction in employment in the farming sector reached approximately 2.3%, while between 1994 and 1999 farming incomes decreased by 15.2%.	52.82568594481272
We all very much share this opinion.	116.06298819212536
Mr Byrne, I ask you to accept and agree to the change of legal basis for the sake of transparency and good cooperation.	113.79853709444579
The Commission's DGs must be made fully responsible for their own expenditure, including financial control.	18.212868256106017
I should like to take this opportunity to stress how important it is that, in future, all the directives are dealt with under Article 152, since both food safety and environmental issues require a coherent policy and a comprehensive overview.	39.05149228222454
Tourism and employment	58.03260999169602
So we shall be freeing up new resources, but - I fear, and I want to state this before Parliament - the time will come when these new resources that we are already freeing up will, in turn, be insufficient in terms of allowing us to address our new tasks: I am thinking of enlargement, the new sector of justice and home affairs, health issues and environmental matters.	91.39099728098542
We must take account of smaller cycles and plant stable mixed woodland when undertaking reforestation, rather than monocultures.	11.56653952933185
In fact, the word seems to have been banished from the Commission' s vocabulary, whereas liberal and American references abound.	24.791485042297705
The capital and securities market has continued to be developed.	105.08369704853203
What we know from the environmental side is what I have already mentioned, that there is now an environmental reconstruction plan, but when it comes to medical check-ups I do not have the information about that.	35.58837242573483
In a directly applicable exception system, consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rules.	52.25081706772895
It is vital that this money is used to benefit the poorest groups and individuals within the ACP countries.	60.941939625313736
The Spanish would see an increase in the price of water for its different uses, owing to the scarcity of water resources and the internalisation of the environmental costs which will have to be met within the framework of the provisions of the directive.	30.690629289207962
There is a possibility, which has not yet been absolutely confirmed, that continuous and direct discussions may take place, with work continuing until September this year.	37.41673920114655
It is perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain cases.	46.210427868973554
Expansion of the agenda and drastic revision of the treaties would bring with it a risk of de-stabilisation.	47.30900657302789
It has been demonstrated in Germany that income from monetary assets has almost doubled from 7.6% of overall economic income since Tobin developed his idea.	37.38287554467052
The reform will lead to a gradual development - I stress this because I was particularly taken with this term, used by Mrs Randzio-Plath, and, moreover, I fully agree with it - of European competition culture.	113.54296507555549
It is in that quasi-provocative spirit that we have presented an amendment suggesting the transfer of responsibility for south-east Europe from Foreign Affairs to Enlargement.	74.3114172202655
A good dose of hypocrisy is needed to overlook our weakness today.	90.21986643423661
The new activity-based management system, that the President just mentioned, will link political priorities to the availability of resources and consequently to the budget for the first time.	92.35884451251509
Well, if the charterer is exonerated, then of course he is less concerned with the inspections which oil companies are responsible for.	111.70635009827073
These are the modern means to be used.	102.30710835056856
In the case of the Balkans, just like everywhere else, one day the United States wants us to destroy the place and the next day they are asking us to rebuild it.	77.63992777161039
Nevertheless, there is no doubt that with the election of the new government, positive steps have been taken: negotiations, at least, have resumed. But in the Middle East, there can be no stable and lasting peace if the Palestinians do not have their own state, if they cannot move freely within their own territory.	41.670318767591795
We have been awaiting a common communication from the Commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it was anything but clear in the past as to whether the Commission speaks with one voice.	34.00550990088378
Once again, the Tobin tax is, in my view, at odds with the Treaty of Rome, and this is an important, theoretical objection which has not been considered by any of the speakers this evening.	21.94195510056115
Without any hesitation, the Russian Minister for Internal Affairs, Vladimir Rushailo, earlier this week confirmed the answer to this revealing question.	102.34547227882993
(The President declared the common position approved (as amended))	3.9246857798376285
Thank you for your reply.	7.1125237194912225
I want to concentrate on Kosovo.	37.48157516031073
It is irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo.	43.63619240265124
As the author is not present, Question No 32 lapses.	12.341745989570166
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to welcome the presentation of, and the first ever debate on, the Commission' s programme for government - the word President Prodi is so fond of; as I am -for the whole legislature.	33.84011532599793
Would the High Representative be prepared to say to what extent this unit, which has been strongly supported by the committee of which I and Mr Titley are members, assisted in providing early information, analysis and an indication of the policy planning options open to yourselves?	65.47023338379122
(SV) My understanding of mainstreaming is, of course, that this should characterise everything we do.	82.72002619409957
The economic growth on which you pride yourself only benefits a fortunate minority, the owners and shareholders of the large industrial and banking groups.	44.06752408856961
Mrs Pack did that in her remarks and anywhere that she is prepared to blaze a trail I think the rest of us should be courageous enough to follow.	86.62799388671576
Mr Katiforis has certainly not lacked the courage to set out the measures which, in his opinion, could help to improve and conserve the natural resources of the sea.	76.93326693026609
A man with three children and he was murdered.	126.02734234539437
Commissioner, do you really think that the facts we have about high infant mortality in Kosovo - the highest in Europe - and more generally the picture of human misery and destruction that prevails in Kosovo, are not already damaging our credibility and casting doubt on our ability to live up to our promises?	81.99989789279749
I support all efforts to close the gap in economic development in infrastructural provisions, including the energy sector.	108.7571470232367
Briefly, just to follow on from that last point, I invite the Commission to make it absolutely clear that the Commission's objections, such as they are, would not in any way infringe the rights of Danish nationals to benefit from this scheme, but simply that the Commission has a concern, which it has the right to have under Community law, to ensure that the scheme applies to all EU citizens who qualify.	50.269222931866516
I believe EU consumers will support those car manufacturers that incorporate the most environmentally-friendly practices in the coming year.	48.696670913433586
Can Commissioner Patten update us on the international coordination so far?	33.46202802990905
I support the Council proposals in this, while deploring a certain lack of strength, a certain spinelessness, on the part of the Commission which will, however, have to be vigilant on a day-by-day basis, with determination over time, since Fascists count on the spinelessness of democracy, they count on time to wear us down and they hope to impose their views in the end.	63.114622933980044
It will certainly be necessary to develop an instrument for this in the anticipated legislative procedure that will enable enterprises to enjoy legal certainty and to have recourse to the Commission in this matter.	45.12312999676503
By its very nature, however, the European Union is, and will remain, a complex and convoluted multi-governmental institution.	55.96040921659662
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report which I have the opportunity to propose to you today is an opinion on the Commission' s Annual Report on the state aid in force within the European Union and for which the Community is authorised under Articles 87, 88 and 89 of the Treaties.	19.666970966403984
In particular, I am referring to the fact that this report - and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this - defends the European social model' s approach, which is one based on solidarity.	19.70653652041495
It is in fact about protecting the euro against counterfeiting, which is an extremely urgent matter.	22.09893171182754
They concern access to training, the ratio of men to women with access to training, and special action for the long-term unemployed.	125.60750002353106
I respect your understanding and knowledge of the Balkan region, Mr Alyssandrakis, but I find it difficult, quite frankly, to understand how respecting the characteristics of the region can, in terms of political stability, be a solution to the problem.	54.4953810483357
Finally, in order to avoid health being treated in any way as a commodity, the European Union should declare itself clearly opposed to pension funds and to a situation where private insurance companies have access to the health system.	51.992354743307004
These events, which are unfortunately overshadowing the political decisions in this area, confirm without doubt that the development of the Tampere Agreements and Title IV of the EC Treaty must be an urgent priority.	46.73621568099693
The reports produced by the WHO indicate that it is fully aware of the alarming infant mortality situation, and it has focused its efforts on improving basic conditions in maternity and general hospitals.	47.43106567451909
It is nevertheless necessary to reach agreement as soon as possible on a new convention which will also take other, even more delicate issues into account: the whole issue of double jeopardy, that of specialities, and that of the credibility of one Member State of the Union in respect of the judicial authorities of other Member States of the Union.	34.883918304629354
I should like to welcome in particular the new LEADER+ programme because of its comprehensive nature.	37.54855768418268
The next item is the report (A5-0009/2000) by Mr Graça Moura, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation ('Culture 2000') (C5-0327/1999 - 1998/0169(COD)).	2.5335831842842484
The wind triumphed over electricity pylons, roofs, traffic signs and, ultimately over the forest.	62.075877380280076
This public prosecutor would have the authority, recognised by the EU Treaty and therefore by the Member States, to investigate thoroughly any case threatening the Community budget and interests.	43.904904129260764
It should, therefore, not surprise us that water is the cause of wars.	145.5373282261941
These rules are all the more welcome in that doubts still persist as regards scrapie.	58.375903685114444
It is therefore only reasonable to put these subjects on the agenda.	49.17383795661048
The Commission must listen to it.	32.37143760511245
Look at the signatories to the conventions on human rights and minorities and then compare the treatment received by such minorities, groups and individuals - the list is shameful and shaming.	122.2484032724254
For ten years you represented democratic Czechoslovakia and, later, the Czech Republic, as its president.	82.26514283187201
Human labour, on the other hand, is considered to be a simple factor in the equation.	31.458214068627413
The Member States do not always have sufficient means at their disposal to address this deprivation adequately.	34.81958428979226
Only a public mail service can guarantee that information technology is within everyone' s reach in society.	82.7300004738687
I hope that the common sense of our fellow MEPs in the other groups will lead them to reject these amendments.	97.92699725064598
That is why this job went to Mr Solana, the Secretary-General of NATO, who is also guilty of the crimes committed against Yugoslavia; the right man for the right job, against whom charges have been filed, calling for him to be tried as a war criminal.	46.291117003582784
Finally, Commissioner, we cannot forget that large sections of the economy are still firmly in the hands of the state, ranging from state television, which is funded on a mandatory basis by the taxpayer, and the Post Office, to some compulsory insurance schemes, including health and social welfare systems, which are managed by inefficient state monopolies which leave no-one but the wealthy user with any other option.	53.53565847985136
In the eyes of the Albanian minority, the Macedonians and the Macedonian state have more than met their neighbourly obligations in respect of Kosovo' s Albanian majority who were persecuted to the extreme.	52.249079566944246
It is an excellent opportunity for this Parliament to introduce far-reaching reforms to these plans.	38.398239519102624
My second question concerns the burden of proof.	11.869424851474848
When projects are implemented, it is also important that they do not contravene general Community legislation.	38.00205186662148
The irresponsibility of certain elected representatives and the barely disguised complicity of the authorities have contributed to this racist explosion.	49.131226976136944
This Military Committee, as you can imagine, will have various duties.	81.15469801369751
It is clear that, for once, the United States has not been able to secure progress on the restarting of these negotiations, and it is true that the obstacles are difficult to overcome: the Syrians wish to regain sovereignty and jurisdiction over the Golan Heights and re-establish the borders which existed before 4 June 1967, while the Israelis wish, since they consider that it suits their situation better, to have the borders which were set in 1923.	65.20360502764444
There are times when a crisis which started out with a military need develops so that, after a few months, a police force is needed rather than a military force. Then, in the final moments of the crisis, it is perhaps courts or bodies to create democratic institutions which a country may need more than police.	89.00451591777403
As for the amendments, I oppose the amendments tabled by Mr Hudghton' s Green colleagues, that is numbers 7 to 13, not because I do not care about the risks to human health but because, according to scientific evidence, the virus does not survive beyond 25o Celsius and according to medical evidence, human beings at that temperature are dead.	75.67759086373627
Firstly, there is the regional approach.	50.101994880917786
This House will of course also be invited to give its views on these proposals, given that these are matters subject to the codecision procedure.	50.79279229644092
Why has the Commission not informed us of this formal request from Macedonia?	41.204117753748996
In setting up numerous hurdles their sole aim is to hamper an efficient ecological material flow policy and by going down the road of type approvals they seek to delay the implementation of the directives by 12 years or more.	50.97242684045561
As far as specific policies are concerned, I would like to pinpoint just one on which the draft resolution focuses - regional policy.	55.602496925112185
Mr President, there is a new doctrine taking shape in international law, according to which no country can treat its citizens or the people living within its territory in any way it likes, and the sovereignty of the state can no longer prevent outside intervention when there are gross violations of human rights, not even when the government is legally or even democratically elected.	46.45702869568738
The feeling of being at the mercy of others, of lacking in influence and of having no protection from the state leads in the best case scenario to a lack of interest in politics and a refusal to vote, as in the European elections and, in the worst case scenario, to extremist voting patterns.	63.167793930494085
We need our governments to put up the financial resources needed to give us effective control and we need them also to stop dragging their feet when it comes to maritime safety.	49.96151964715792
A total of 48 amendments have been tabled.	50.447154593695785
When it comes to so-called development aid, given that underdevelopment in the majority of these countries is getting worse rather than better, development is clearly not what the aid is for, even when it is not just a disguised export subsidy for European manufacturers.	57.39179772127922
But we also know that we can only shape the huge challenge of globalisation together as Europeans.	41.660561548156544
I will take another look at the issue, although I should point out that having two PHARE programmes up and running risks real confusion.	20.9656991063526
When I read Mr van Hulten' s passage about personnel policy, I am afraid that Parliament may again be failing to tackle the crucial issues and just spouting a lot of hot air.	57.54963052442571
This is an unwise policy.	16.168607044651043
First, there is the right of distribution as referred to in Article 8(1).	39.60937892516567
The adoption procedure for the programmes is established by the general regulations on Structural Funds.	126.19677011532879
We must also critically examine the classification societies.	25.436530974693785
Given the environmental and demographic developments, if anything, we ought to encourage Member States to pursue a selective economic growth policy.	95.8443730514618
Let us point out that Parliament' s positions were clearly defined and that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance supported them.	14.631169806054654
For over a year the old Commission could have done some work on this.	104.30973295500165
We have to act now, before it is too late.	49.621637319170475
We have a direct financial interest in these issues being settled before enlargement.	56.63162653484253
It promotes mobility, and it opens the doors of culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded.	148.47449141259403
We are also of the opinion that Community funds should be set aside to fund these activities.	49.70199702230021
The European Union contributes 75% of the Peace and Reconciliation programme.	18.718718040732185
There is a very simple way to deal with those stories.	28.075347245836326
After all, the very bad experiences so far with disciplinary proceedings show all too clearly how necessary it is that we carry out reforms.	28.219231442810425
Schengen has been incorporated, as we said earlier, into the acquis, but it has been done with very little transparency.	58.94921584784305
If we do not have this picture then it will not be possible to make reasonable decisions in two years' time about the future of the policy.	42.51604100098129
The IRA terrorists have not given up any of their weapons, nor have the loyalist terrorists, yet the police are being forced into a position where they will not have the power to resist the terrorist community.	177.16454661980228
In 1910, a woman' s right to vote was on the agenda.	24.126894334335134
In institutional terms, there has been no clarification of what role the EP is to play in the further development of the WIPO Treaties.	43.326942007946165
Now it is freedom, security and justice, and I hope that the current governments of the left will heed the words of Commissioner Vitorino and resist the temptation to elevate security, important as it is, above the equally important needs of freedom and justice.	32.044952146574204
Before the final vote:	77.09404707100188
The Commission' s proposal introduces a clear procedure for selecting substances, and so no definition is needed.	33.666149155857575
Secondly, apart from the shipowners' liability, it would be a good idea in such cases to examine the liability of the charterers, for example the oil companies which are also responsible for causing ecological disasters like this and, of course, for restoring the damage.	62.25285770191345
It was pointed out, during the discussion of Mr Brok' s excellent report in committee, that both countries can also benefit from the MEDA budget line for horizontal projects of regional interest.	85.44906833857482
Declarations of principle are not enough.	35.612345498735756
I must stress once again the Portuguese Presidency' s earnest desire for political agreement to be reached on the scoreboard at the informal Council in Lisbon on 3 and 4 March.	65.42150840974793
I hope that in the next few hours we will have more information from Commissioner Gil-Robles and, in particular, better news from the Russian authorities.	37.436700121397955
I have received seven motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the Rules of Procedure.	4.86526142834129
Secondly, I must also assert my total conviction that neither Spain nor Andalusia is xenophobic or racist. Of course this does not mean that I do not totally condemn the violence used by individuals or groups who deserve to be prosecuted firmly and rigorously by the law, and by the law alone.	54.576348237210766
The political priorities must be set by this House and the MEPs.	72.49149118231364
We are pleased that all the rural areas of the Union may be involved in LEADER+, but we believe that it is necessary to concentrate Community resources in the less-favoured regions in order to facilitate the process of socio-economic cohesion within the Union, and that state governments should not divert these resources towards objectives other than cohesion.	47.9958917685293
For this reason, it is essential that the Council' s debates on the future of Europol and Eurojust should be conducted in parallel, so that conclusions can be reached in parallel also.	27.243684220932476
In view of this positive action, there is every advantage to be gained from according the Joint Assembly a budget compatible with improving the quality of its work.	53.244521977747034
